Significant Usability Issues:
  Once you start auto-completing a WS name, the drop-down should stay up to allow several path selections
    NN: I'm not even getting autocompletion for WS names...
  Typing )off gives an "Uncaught node.js Error" - could we keep the session visible and have a calm notification?
    NN: cannot reproduce (NW Windows), I'm getting an "Interpreter disconnected" as expected
  Would be nice if captions [titles of floating windows] name the thing being edited
  Shift-tab should cycle between the windows
  It would be nice with an option to have all editor windows open as floating (WPF Ride and ODE have this)
  about 0.5-0.75 line of margin at the bottom, below the input line
  shift+enter doesn't work on a Mac

Needed by v14.1:
  F1 should open the local help for language elements, but this help should have links to help.dyalog.com for the rest
  Need a full keyboarding discussion: Whether to report/adapt to IME keystrokes, etc
  Shift+Esc while editing a namespace: TypeError: Cannot read property info of undefined
    NN: cannot reproduce, possibly fixed
  re-take screenshot
  Connect page: prompt user to save before selection changes

Later:
  rewrite syntax highlighting to support Dyalog syntax
  Highlight non-local names in a different colour (this is BY FAR the most useful syntax colouring)
  selecting a block of text and pressing ⍝ should comment/uncomment it
  automatically pop up completion box after a timeout
  save line number display configuration (on/off)
  status window and notification about number of messages
  a shortcut to align ⍝-s (suggested by Kai)
  experiment with storing all help content in browser memory
  searchable help files
  keybindings for toolbar buttons
  keybinding for toggling a breakpoint
  ` keybindings in search box
  contextual help (F1) for items in completion menus
  js strict mode
  source maps
  display a "mailto:" link when a SysError happens
  search field history
  can ExpressJS (the web server) gzip static files in advance?
  code folding and [+] button
  SI stack in debugger (?)
  remember window size and position
  strong interrupt (?)

Done:
  If an error is encountered in a scripted fn, tracer needs to scroll to line which failed
  )ed namespace.foo should position cursor at start of foo
  Trace namespace.foo should scroll so that traced code is at the TOP of the window
  Need Help|About feature to allow include version information when reporting issues
  about dialog with version: 0.1. + commit counter, and also build date
  menus (only within the browser window)
  BS and left cursor should terminate autocomplete dropdown (like ESC). Right cursor/tab should select and continue
  "uncomment selected line" button doesn't work if nothing is selected
  If a namespace or class cannot be saved, the "unable to save" popup does not have the focus when it appears
    NN: Windows-only issue, replaced all alert()-s with $().dialog()-s to dodge it
  ctrl+TAB should cycle between editors and session windows as in ODE (and in a Web Browser)
    NN: Done, but Chromium refuses to remap ctrl+tab
  control font size in node-webkit
    NN: can't capture scroll events in NW, but I made <C-+> <C--> <C-0> work
  control font size (in all windows)
  Type something, hit shift enter on function name: Editor opens OK, but session log input is subsequently discarded
  revert line in session should move cursor to next line (suggested by Scholes)
  the interpreter's +s option (used by "Spawn") causes the interpreter to crash on error in the session
    NN: "+s -q" solves this, thanks Geoff
  listen for connections from the interpreter
  add menu items for zoom in/out
  ctrl+enter in debugger should do the same as enter
  reduce size of the desktop app's executable: we don't need all versions of the font
    NN: binary is still rather large, ~80MB
  app icon, an orange D
  Update focus after closing an editor (not fixed in Dec 24 version)
    NN: debuggers only
  honour ReplyHadError when executing multiple lines
  continuously update completion list while typing
  log file, env var to control its location
  Focus should go back to the session when you close a window
  keyboard navigation in menu (Alt+..., F10, arrows, etc)
