Bugs / Issues External to RIDE
  Mac and Windows not working at all for spawned interpreters
  Intermittent crashes(!)
  Auto-completion of workspace names not working outside Windows   JD #11879
  The interpreter must refuse to start if $RIDE_LISTEN is given, but the port is already being used  JD #11252
  History (session log) is not recorded in spawned interpreters; Geoff #11841
  The interpreter ignores $RIDE_CONNECT and $RIDE_LISTEN; reported by Kai, reproduced by Nick, fix by JD or Bjørn pending
  Show PID in title, along with WS name.  It needs to be added to the RIDE protocol

Formatting / Rendering Issues
  We need some white space / margin at the bottom, below the input line
  Overflown part of connections box doesn't show
  App icons for Mac & Windows (Jason is on the case)

Urgent Usability Issues
  Shift+enter doesn't work on a Mac (observed on John Scholes' Mac)
  Connect page: prompt user to save before selection changes
  Connect page: "Save" is enabled although nothing is selected in the favs list; reported by Morten 2015-02-11 over XMPP
  Autocompletion doesn't work; reported by Morten in an email from 2015-02-11, Nick can't reproduce it

Less Urgent (but needed for 14.1):
  Verify there is a standard key to cycle between the windows
  Once you start auto-completing a WS name, the drop-down should stay up to allow several path selections
  Pasting multiple lines in the session should be impossible (or pressing Enter should be emulated at every '\n')
  A menu item to open another instance of the IDE (a quick and dirty replacement for "go back to connect screen" / "multiple sessions")

Nice to have for v14.1:
  Option to automatically pop up completion box after a timeout OR use a keystroke
  search and replace; search is there, replace isn't
  js source maps
  If possible, keyboard shortcuts (`x) to be compatible with Dyalog Hardware keyboards (i.e. positional)
  Re-dock floating windows
  Import RIDE1 settings from %HOME%\AppData\Local\Ride\Ride.exe_...
  About dialogue should be accessible somehow from Connect page
  About: "Copy" should always copy all the text

Later:
  make it easy to transfer IDE settings from one machine to another, e.g. save settings to the cloud
  drag and drop *.dws and *.dyalog files in the session
  rewrite syntax highlighting to support Dyalog syntax
  Highlight non-local names in a different colour (this is BY FAR the most useful syntax colouring)
  selecting a block of text and pressing ⍝ should comment/uncomment it
  save line number display configuration (on/off)
  status window and notification about number of messages
  experiment with storing all help content in browser memory
  searchable help files
  keybindings for toolbar buttons
  keybinding for toggling a breakpoint
  ` keybindings in search box
  contextual help (F1) for items in completion menus
  js strict mode
  source maps
  display a "mailto:" link when a SysError happens
  search field history
  code folding and [+] button
  SI stack in debugger (?)
  strong interrupt (?)
  native menus in nwjs, including an out-of-window menu on Mac
  start web server from nwjs GUI (?)
  add legalese to About dialogue
  IDE config in the cloud

Done:
  If an error is encountered in a scripted fn, tracer needs to scroll to line which failed
  )ed namespace.foo should position cursor at start of foo
  Trace namespace.foo should scroll so that traced code is at the TOP of the window
  Need Help|About feature to allow include version information when reporting issues
  about dialog with version: 0.1. + commit counter, and also build date
  menus (only within the browser window)
  BS and left cursor should terminate autocomplete dropdown (like ESC). Right cursor/tab should select and continue
  "uncomment selected line" button doesn't work if nothing is selected
  If a namespace or class cannot be saved, the "unable to save" popup does not have the focus when it appears
    NN: Windows-only issue, replaced all alert()-s with $().dialog()-s to dodge it
  ctrl+TAB should cycle between editors and session windows as in ODE (and in a Web Browser)
    NN: Done, but Chromium refuses to remap ctrl+tab
  control font size in nwjs
    NN: can't capture scroll events in NW, but I made <C-+> <C--> <C-0> work
  control font size (in all windows)
  Type something, hit shift enter on function name: Editor opens OK, but session log input is subsequently discarded
  revert line in session should move cursor to next line (suggested by Scholes)
  the interpreter's +s option (used by "Spawn") causes the interpreter to crash on error in the session
    NN: "+s -q" solves this, thanks Geoff
  listen for connections from the interpreter
  add menu items for zoom in/out
  ctrl+enter in debugger should do the same as enter
  reduce size of the desktop app's executable: we don't need all versions of the font
    NN: binary is still rather large, ~80MB
  app icon, an orange D
  Update focus after closing an editor (not fixed in Dec 24 version)
    NN: debuggers only
  honour ReplyHadError when executing multiple lines
  continuously update completion list while typing
  log file, env var to control its location
  Focus should go back to the session when you close a window
  keyboard navigation in menu (Alt+..., F10, arrows, etc)
  remember window size and position
  a shortcut to align ⍝-s (suggested by Kai)
  Would be nice if captions [titles of floating windows] name the thing being edited
  It would be nice with an option to have all editor windows open as floating (WPF Ride and ODE have this)
  re-take screenshot
  multiple debuggers (actually: fixed updating of title in *the* debugger)
  occasionally at startup parts of the window do not paint
  Debugger toolbar has extra icons
  CSS class to indicate when window is focus
  "undefined" appears in the session when you hold the enter key for a while
  Esc shouldn't save when no changes have been made
  When spawning an interpreter, make it connect back to the IDE (use RIDE_CONNECT instead of RIDE_LISTEN)
  Changing font size doesn't affect floating windows
  Disable dragging between editor and debugger tabs
  Debugger doesn't highlight current line when in a floating window
  Command line arguments for bypassing the Connect screen, e.g. --spawn or --connect 1.2.3.4:4502
  Add button to float windows
  Show host:port in title, along with WS name
  Floating windows should be always on top (can add option post v14.1)
  Connections box should be wide enough for "typical" entries; ideally resizable
