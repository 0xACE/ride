Bugs / Issues External to RIDE
  Windows not working at all for spawned interpreters
  History (session log) is not recorded in spawned interpreters; Geoff #11841
  Yes/No dialogue, needs to be supported in the RIDE protocol; email from Morten 2015-02-14
  
P1 (Definitely high priority):
  
P2 (Middle priority):
  Do not scroll session on AtInputPrompt.
  Scroll editor window if cursor passes right margin.
  add replace (:%s/A/B/)
  ` keybindings and/or lbar should work in search box
  Remove brief display of connect screen on "New Session"
  Allow RIDE to be started on Mac OS X as a separate item
  
P3 (Can wait):
  Add meta-information to Windows executable: author, version, etc, accessible through Right click > Properties
    NN: Investigate: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/284258/how-do-i-set-the-version-information-for-an-existing-exe-dll (sent by JD)
  Overflown part of connections box doesn't show
    NN: not that much of a problem now that it's resizable
  Customizable window title; Kai email 2015-02-24
  Verify there is a standard key to cycle between the windows
  Enable Windows IME if present.

P4 (I will think about it):
  Option to automatically pop up completion box after a timeout OR use a keystroke

Later:
  make it easy to transfer IDE settings from one machine to another, e.g. save settings to the cloud
  drag and drop *.dws and *.dyalog files in the session
  rewrite syntax highlighting to support Dyalog syntax
  selecting a block of text and pressing ⍝ should comment/uncomment it
  status window and notification about number of messages
  experiment with storing all help content in browser memory
  searchable help files
  keybindings for toolbar buttons
  keybinding for toggling a breakpoint
  contextual help (F1) for items in completion menus
  js strict mode
  display a "mailto:" link when a SysError happens
  search field history
  code folding and [+] button
  SI stack in debugger (?)
  start web server from nwjs GUI (?)
  add legalese to About dialogue

Done:
  If an error is encountered in a scripted fn, tracer needs to scroll to line which failed
  )ed namespace.foo should position cursor at start of foo
  Trace namespace.foo should scroll so that traced code is at the TOP of the window
  Need Help|About feature to allow include version information when reporting issues
  about dialog with version: 0.1. + commit counter, and also build date
  menus (only within the browser window)
  BS and left cursor should terminate autocomplete dropdown (like ESC). Right cursor/tab should select and continue
  "uncomment selected line" button doesn't work if nothing is selected
  If a namespace or class cannot be saved, the "unable to save" popup does not have the focus when it appears
    NN: Windows-only issue, replaced all alert()-s with $().dialog()-s to dodge it
  ctrl+TAB should cycle between editors and session windows as in ODE (and in a Web Browser)
    NN: Done, but Chromium refuses to remap ctrl+tab
  control font size in nwjs
    NN: can't capture scroll events in NW, but I made <C-+> <C--> <C-0> work
  control font size (in all windows)
  Type something, hit shift enter on function name: Editor opens OK, but session log input is subsequently discarded
  revert line in session should move cursor to next line (suggested by Scholes)
  the interpreter's +s option (used by "Spawn") causes the interpreter to crash on error in the session
    NN: "+s -q" solves this, thanks Geoff
  listen for connections from the interpreter
  add menu items for zoom in/out
  ctrl+enter in debugger should do the same as enter
  reduce size of the desktop app's executable: we don't need all versions of the font
    NN: binary is still rather large, ~80MB
  app icon, an orange D
  Update focus after closing an editor (not fixed in Dec 24 version)
    NN: debuggers only
  honour ReplyHadError when executing multiple lines
  continuously update completion list while typing
  log file, env var to control its location
  Focus should go back to the session when you close a window
  keyboard navigation in menu (Alt+..., F10, arrows, etc)
  remember window size and position
  a shortcut to align ⍝-s (suggested by Kai)
  Would be nice if captions [titles of floating windows] name the thing being edited
  It would be nice with an option to have all editor windows open as floating (WPF Ride and ODE have this)
  re-take screenshot
  multiple debuggers (actually: fixed updating of title in *the* debugger)
  occasionally at startup parts of the window do not paint
  Debugger toolbar has extra icons
  CSS class to indicate when window is focus
  "undefined" appears in the session when you hold the enter key for a while
  Esc shouldn't save when no changes have been made
  When spawning an interpreter, make it connect back to the IDE (use RIDE_CONNECT instead of RIDE_LISTEN)
  Changing font size doesn't affect floating windows
  Disable dragging between editor and debugger tabs
  Debugger doesn't highlight current line when in a floating window
  Command line arguments for bypassing the Connect screen, e.g. --spawn or --connect 1.2.3.4:4502
  Add button to float windows
  Show host:port in title, along with WS name
  Floating windows should be always on top (can add option post v14.1)
  Connections box should be wide enough for "typical" entries; ideally resizable
  About: "Copy" should always copy all the text
  Pasting multiple lines in the session should be impossible (or pressing Enter should be emulated at every '\n')
  Change name of executable from "dyalogjs" to "ride"
  Autocompletion: Tab/Shift-Tab should cycle through the list (Nick)
  About dialogue should be accessible somehow from Connect page
  Context menu ("Copy", "Paste", etc) on right mouse click
  9) Would be good to have a keystroke to go back one line in the tracer.
    NN: I added Shift-Ctrl-Backspace (BK) and Shift-Ctrl-Enter (FD), as AS suggested
  6) If you are tracing and encounter an error in a sub-function, you have to explicitly hit CTRL+ENTER to get the tracer to recognise the new stack levels. This may be a configuration option that is off by default in Linux(?). Or perhaps does not even exist in Linux?
    NN: Ctrl-Enter now does "step into" instead of "step over"
  10) In the Connect screen, a "Save" is required before Connect uses the parameters that have been entered into the edit boxes. This is quite confusing.
    NN: fixed and moved Connect button under the text fields
  4) Ctrl+Enter works fine from immediate execution, but doesn't seem to work reliably as a "step into" key once you are already tracing.
  save line number display configuration (on/off)
  JS2: Line numbers: I would prefer the editor to remember my preference for no line numbers between invocations.
  line wrapping in the session needs to be optional; MK email 2015-02-21
  If you hit quote three times, you end up with first one, then two, then SIX quotes
    NN: Patch submitted.  Will be available with the next release of CodeMirror: https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/pull/3083
    NN: I decided to disable pairing of '' and "".
  2) Double-click in the session does not open the editor.
  JS email 2015-02-19:
    JS5: )load dfns and type )fns - the display doesn’t seem to honour ⎕PW, so I see some of my fns spread over two lines of output.
    JS6: An auto-⎕PW option (I suggest default) would be very nice.
      NN: implemented optional line wrapping instead
  Autocomplete displays all ⎕names in an unexpected order; GS #11928
  App icons for Mac & Windows (Jason)
  Change background for search matches; MK email 2015-02-18
  3) AutoComplete using <ENTER> is a nightmare and causes all sorts of unexpected behaviours. If you have functions FOO and FOOBAR, it is almost impossible to call FOO. You type FOO and hit enter but if you think about it for a split second, the RIDE stuffs the "BAR" in just before you hit <ENTER> and you run the wrong function. Or you type )save and hit <ENTER>, but all that happens is that ")save" becomes ")SAVE" and you have to hit <ENTER> again.
  Auto-complete should probably not complete on enter, this can cause very bad problems if the user is not carefully looking
    NN: fixed by adding an extra invisible item before other completions; pressing <enter> on it does ER
  Floating editor windows should be always on top of the session but not on top of other applications; MK email 2015-02-17
  7) When tracing into functions, the window caption doesn't reflect the function name that you have now moved into.
  8) When tracing near the top of a function, the function header needs to be visible. At the moment, the first line displayed is typically the current line, even when you are only on line [1].
  <End> should go to the last non-blank character; MK email 2015-02-17
  Find an acceptable solution for pasting multiple lines into the session, in particular: single line with a trailing newline; MK email 2015-02-17
  13) I am coming to the conclusion that the editor windows need to be on top of the APL session but not on top of everything in the universe.
  Connect page: prompt user to save before selection changes
    NN: this is N/A now that we moved the Connect button below the text fields
  js source maps
  Auto-complete should not happen at quote-quad input
  source maps
  Highlight non-local names in a different colour (this is BY FAR the most useful syntax colouring)
  Mac not working at all for spawned interpreters
  Auto-completion of workspace names not working outside Windows   JD #11879
  The interpreter must refuse to start if $RIDE_LISTEN is given, but the port is already being used  JD #11252
  The interpreter ignores $RIDE_CONNECT and $RIDE_LISTEN; reported by Kai, reproduced by Nick, fix by JD or Bjørn pending
  clean shutdown of APL should terminate RIDE
  Two menu items to spawn a new IDE: connect page and new session (Cmd+N)
  Add menu items to issue interrupt(s).
  On startup, make sure the window fits in the screen (to avoid trouble with multiple screens)
  Don't show connect screen on "New Session" and on "-s" argument
  Two highlighted lines in tracer; MK email 2015-02-14:
    1) You are tracing
    2) You use shift+enter to edit the function
    3) You then use >> or << before resuming execution
      NN: I was showing a red border around the current line in edit mode, which was wrong
  Rationalize menus for OS X and others
  If you maximize RIDE on a Mac, close it, and open it again, it can't be unmaximised; 2015-02-19 JS, JR
    NN: fixed as a side effect of fixing the issue with multiple monitors
  "Connect" and "New Session" do not work under OS X
  Do not start in the connect screen on "New Session" and on "-s" argument
  DB email 2015-03-03
    Save breakpoints the moment you click, not on EP
