Decision pending regarding initial handshake:
  * fix Identify message and/or redefine its semantics in docs/protocol.md
  * remove the second part of the handshake (UsingProtocol=1), this may be in Bjørn's code
  * don't send a ReplyConnect message

Things to be done in the interpreter:
  * in GetAutocomplete either rename "token" to "win" or don't require them to be the same
  * interpreter can start using OptionsDialog/StringDialog/TaskDialog for external files, see M5,S3 below
  * define and implement protocol messages for "show stack" and "show threads", see W1,W2 below
  * define protocol messages for transferring a file to the interpreter, e.g. for drag&drop of a .dws
  * don't crash when receiving JSON that's not structured as expected
  * dev version of interpreter doesn't honour "+s -q" over ssh (probably one for Geoff), see email from 2016-01-28
  * take into account modified editor content in Edit message

Leftover from RIDE3 (M:major, S:significant, W:wouldn't it be nice)
  M2 awareness of Process Manager
  M5 edit "external" source files
        NN: email 2016-01-20, added a "string input dialog" to the protocol
        NN: email 2016-01-28, "format on open" should be off by default for external source files
  M6 support external editors
        NN: implemented in its simplest form -- execute a command with a tmp file as argument.
            Emacs works fine.  Gvim will probably work, too.  Vim requires a wrapper script to run in a terminal, e.g.:
                #!/bin/bash
                xterm -e vim "$1"
        NN: Do we need GUI for this?
  M7 add meta-information to Windows exe
  S1 export and import preferences
        NN: not needed because preferences are already in a file in human-readable form
  S2 config file for interpreter
  S5 enhanced navigation of classes and functions
        e.g. provide a way to jump to the last edited position in the same editor, like '' or `` in vim
        (meeting with Morten and Jay, 2016-01-08)
                NN: done but there are some issues with editing classes, see docs/protocol.md #Edit
  W1 show stack
  W2 show threads
  W3 status bar
        NN: done in RIDE, except for "flags" (warning, error, etc)
        NN: it turns out no content is available for the status bar, therefore I removed it, see email 2016-04-07

Not prioritized:
  configurable list for ``
  ``idiomname
  <AC> on <RD>
  programmable menu items
  on a Mac esc closes the session instead of the editor, JS 2015-12-03
  cmd to toggle rainbow colouring
  names of open editors should appear at the bottom of the Window menu; Marc Griffiths 2015-03-13
    NN: not convinced that would be useful
  View>Theme should change the theme in all existing windows
  Ctrl+Cmd+Space on the Mac starts a "Special Characters" application -- find a way to disable it
    NN: "Special Characters" and "Start Dictation" are added based on the presence of "Copy" in the menu.
        But if we don't have "Copy" in the menu, cmd+c doesn't work.
  make it easy to transfer IDE settings from one machine to another, e.g. save settings to the cloud (Kai)
  check for updates automatically - Jason, 2015-10-12
  2015-09-07 Adam: shortcut to clear the "modified" flag of a line in session without reverting it to original content
  selecting a block of text and pressing ⍝ should comment/uncomment it
  Integrate docs in RIDE?  We need fast, searchable, bookmarkable help content!
  support for user commands (syntax highlighting)
  JS: Arrange for the banner to appear at the _top_ of a new session.
    NN: I did some experimentation with this.  As of now, I can only get it appear on top about 50% of the time
         due to a race condition in NW.js's events.
  2015-09-08 Ken Mellem: custom syntax highlighting in comments
    NN: added a simple example: ./sample-extensions/syntax-in-comments.js
  2015-09-07 Ray: status bar and programmatic access to "current object"
  2015-09-07 Jim Brown: custom fonts
  https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/issues/3240
    WebKit stores DOM height in 25 bits, ~33 million pixels.  When displaying
    large arrays (~millions of lines, depending on font size), CodeMirror hits
    that limit and it's impossible to scroll beyond a certain offset.  This is
    hard to work around without going deep into CodeMirror's code and rewriting
    parts of it.
  get rid of jquery.layout.js (180k for a splitter plugin is too much)
  There should be no flashing cursors in windows that don't have focus; JS 2015-03-21
  if we spawn an interpreter and it fails to connect after X time, please could we have a message box about it? - Andy email 2015-06-29
  (OS X) - Reported by Mike Powell: Dragging the text to a different point uses the vertical bar cursor. Holding the Option key while doing this changes the cursor to the green and white cross (Implying a copy - but it still moves the text).
  Type a couple of chars and hit Alt+Enter, followed by Enter. Uncaught node.js Error; JS email 2015-03-10
    NN: cannot reproduce on Linux
  There is a limit for the number of match locations shown on the scrollbar (1000) -- should we change it?
  JS: Floating editors: )ed F G should place F above G and focus F. Then Esc Esc should close F and then G.
    NN: the interpreter controls the order; that's even beyond JD's code
  "Cancel" button in "Connecting..." dialog; MK Jabber 2015-03-30
    NN: added "Cancel" button, though it doesn't really cancel, just closes the dialog
  Regular expressions in search
  Multiple sessions (i.e. connections to interpreters) as tabs with a green/red dot to indicate error, suggested by Mike Mingard
  Show help next to ` completions (Mike Mingard)
    NN: I made F1 open a help page based on selection in the menu
  2015-09-09 Adam: curly underlines
  lbar in floating editor windows
  favicon.ico is too large (~120k)
  Sortable language bar
  Detachable language bar (Mike Mingard)
  Drag and drop a "finder object" in the Mac RIDE crashes it (Alex Bochannek, 2015-06-25)
  RIDE on multiple screens on Mac loses its title bar (Alex Bochannek, 2015-06-25)
  profile selection
  search history
  start web server from nwjs GUI (?)
  invert cursor colour (Alex Bochannek, 2015-10-20)
  support Mac's "Cmd" key (Alex Bochannek & Alexey Veretennikov, 2015-10-20)
  custom themes (Alexey Veretennikov, 2015-10-20)
  remove invisible scrollbars on Mac (Alexey Veretennikov, 2015-10-20)
