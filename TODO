Significant Usibility Issues:
  ctrl+TAB should cycle between editors and session windows as in ODE (and in a Web Browser)
  BS and left cursor should terminate autocomplete dropdown (like ESC). Right cursor/tab should select and continue
  Once you start auto-completing a WS name, the drop-down should stay up to allow several path selections
  If a namespace or class cannot be saved, the "unable to save" popup does not have the focus when it appears
  Typing )off gives an "Uncaught node.js Error" - could we keep the session visible and have a calm notification?

Needed by v14.1:
  Floating editor windows
  F1 should open the local help for language elements, but this help should have links to help.dyalog.com for the rest
  Need a full keyboarding discussion: Whether to report/adapt to IME keystrokes, etc
  "uncomment selected line" button doesn't work if nothing is selected
  continuously update completion list while typing
  Shift+Esc while editing a namespace: TypeError: Cannot read property info of undefined
  menus (only within the browser window)
  about dialog with version: 0.1. + commit counter, and also build date
  listen for connections from the interpreter
  control font size in node-webkit
  revert line in session should move cursor to next line (suggested by Scholes)
  re-take screenshot

Later:
  rewrite syntax highlighting to support Dyalog syntax
  Highlight non-local names in a different colour (this is BY FAR the most useful syntax colouring)
  selecting a block of text and pressing ⍝ should comment/uncomment it
  automatically pop up completion box after a timeout
  save line number display configuration (on/off)
  status window and notification about number of messages
  a shoftcut to align ⍝-s (suggested by Kai)
  experiment with storing all help content in browser memory
  searchable help files
  keybindings for toolbar buttons
  keybinding for toggling a breakpoint
  ` keybindings in search box
  contextual help (F1) for items in completion menus
  js strict mode
  display a "mailto:" link when a SysError happens
  search field history
  can ExpressJS (the web server) gzip static files in advance?
  code folding and [+] button
  SI stack in debugger (?)

Done:
  If an error is encountered in a scripted fn, tracer needs to scroll to line which failed
  Update focus after closing an editor
  )ed namespace.foo should position cursor at start of foo
  Trace namespace.foo should scroll so that traced code is at the TOP of the window
