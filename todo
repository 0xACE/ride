Decision pending regarding initial handshake:
  * fix Identify message and/or redefine its semantics in docs/protocol.md
  * don't send a ReplyConnect message

Things to be done in the interpreter:
  * in GetAutocomplete either rename "token" to "win" or don't require them to be the same
  * define and implement protocol messages for "show stack" and "show threads", see W1,W2 below
  * define protocol messages for transferring a file to the interpreter, e.g. for drag&drop of a .dws
  * don't crash when receiving JSON that's not structured as expected
  * dev version of interpreter doesn't honour "+s -q" over ssh (probably one for Geoff), see email from 2016-01-28
  * take into account modified editor content in Edit message

Leftover from RIDE3 (M:major, S:significant, W:wouldn't it be nice)
  M2 awareness of Process Manager
  M5 edit "external" source files
        NN: email 2016-01-20, added a "string input dialog" to the protocol
        NN: email 2016-01-28, "format on open" should be off by default for external source files
  S2 config file for interpreter
  S5 enhanced navigation of classes and functions
        e.g. provide a way to jump to the last edited position in the same editor, like '' or `` in vim
        (meeting with Morten and Jay, 2016-01-08)
                NN: done but there are some issues with editing classes, see docs/protocol.md #Edit
  W1 show stack
  W2 show threads

Not prioritized:
  configurable colours in WSE (Mantis #13629, email 2016-07-05)
  font size in value tips should match font size in CodeMirror
  configurable list for ``
  ``idiomname
  <AC> on <RD>
  programmable menu items
  on a Mac esc closes the session instead of the editor (John Scholes 2015-12-03)
  cmd to toggle rainbow colouring
  names of open editors should appear at the bottom of the Window menu (Marc Griffiths 2015-03-13)
    NN: not convinced that would be useful
  Ctrl+Cmd+Space on the Mac starts a "Special Characters" application -- find a way to disable it
    NN: "Special Characters" and "Start Dictation" are added based on the presence of "Copy" in the menu.
        But if we don't have "Copy" in the menu, cmd+c doesn't work.
  make it easy to transfer IDE settings from one machine to another, e.g. save settings to the cloud (Kai)
  check for updates automatically (Jason, 2015-10-12)
  shortcut to clear the "modified" flag of a line in session without reverting it to original content (Adam 2015-09-07)
  selecting a block of text and pressing ‚çù should comment/uncomment it
  status bar and programmatic access to "current object" (2015-09-07 Ray)
  custom fonts (2015-09-07 Jim Brown)
  https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/issues/3240
    WebKit stores DOM height in 25 bits, ~33 million pixels.  When displaying
    large arrays (~millions of lines, depending on font size), CodeMirror hits
    that limit and it's impossible to scroll beyond a certain offset.  This is
    hard to work around without going deep into CodeMirror's code and rewriting
    parts of it.
  there should be no flashing cursors in windows that don't have focus (John Scholes 2015-03-21)
  if we spawn an interpreter and it fails to connect after X time, please could we have a message box about it? (Andy email 2015-06-29)
  on OS X dragging the text to a different point uses the vertical bar cursor. Holding the Option key while doing this
    changes the cursor to the green and white cross (Implying a copy - but it still moves the text).  (Mike Powell)
  Type a couple of chars and hit Alt+Enter, followed by Enter. Uncaught node.js Error (John Scholes email 2015-03-10)
    NN: cannot reproduce on Linux
  there is a limit for the number of match locations shown on the scrollbar (1000) -- should we change it?
  floating editors: )ed F G should place F above G and focus F. Then Esc Esc should close F and then G (John Scholes)
    NN: the interpreter controls the order; that's even beyond JD's code
  "Cancel" button in "Connecting..." dialog (Morten, Jabber 2015-03-30)
    NN: added "Cancel" button, though it doesn't really cancel, just closes the dialog
  regular expressions in search
  multiple sessions (i.e. connections to interpreters) as tabs with a green/red dot to indicate error (Mike Mingard)
  show help next to ` completions (Mike Mingard)
    NN: I made F1 open a help page based on selection in the menu
  curly underlines (Adam 2015-09-09)
  lbar in floating editor windows
  sortable language bar
  detachable language bar (Mike Mingard)
  drag and drop a "finder object" in the Mac RIDE crashes it (Alex Bochannek 2015-06-25)
  RIDE on multiple screens on Mac loses its title bar (Alex Bochannek 2015-06-25)
  search history
  invert cursor colour (Alex Bochannek 2015-10-20)
  custom themes (Alexey Veretennikov 2015-10-20)
    NN: there's $RIDE_CSS for that - it loads extra css file
  remove invisible scrollbars on Mac (Alexey Veretennikov 2015-10-20)
