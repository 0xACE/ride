Leftover from RIDE3 (M:major, S:significant, W:wouldn't it be nice)
  M5 edit "external" source files
        NN: email 2016-01-20, added a "string input dialog" to the protocol
        NN: email 2016-01-28, "format on open" should be off by default for external source files

Not prioritized:
  define protocol messages for transferring a file to the interpreter, e.g. for drag&drop of a .dws
  dev version of interpreter doesn't honour "+s -q" over ssh (probably one for Geoff), see email from 2016-01-28
  <AC> on <RD>
  make it easy to transfer IDE settings from one machine to another, e.g. save settings to the cloud (Kai)
  programmatic access to "current object" (2015-09-07 Ray)
  https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/issues/3240
    WebKit stores DOM height in 25 bits, ~33 million pixels.  When displaying
    large arrays (~millions of lines, depending on font size), CodeMirror hits
    that limit and it's impossible to scroll beyond a certain offset.  This is
    hard to work around without going deep into CodeMirror's code and rewriting
    parts of it.

    NN: added "Cancel" button, though it doesn't really cancel, just closes the dialog
