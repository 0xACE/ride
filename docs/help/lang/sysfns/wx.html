<body><h2><tt>⎕WX</tt>Window Expose </h2><p><tt>⎕WX</tt> is a system variable that determines:</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li value="1">whether or not the names of properties, methods and events provided by a Dyalog APL GUI object are exposed. </li><li value="2">certain aspects of behaviour of .Net and COM objects.</li></ol><p>The permitted values of <tt>⎕WX</tt> are 0, 1, or 3. Considered as a sum of bit flags, the first bit in <tt>⎕WX</tt> specifies (a), and the second bit specifies (b).</p><p>If <tt>⎕WX</tt> is 1 (1<sup>st</sup> bit is set), the names of properties, methods and events are exposed as reserved names in GUI namespaces and can be accessed directly by name. This means that the same names may not be used for global variables in GUI namespaces.</p><p>If <tt>⎕WX</tt> is 0, these names are hidden and may only be accessed indirectly using <tt>⎕WG</tt> and <tt>⎕WS</tt>.</p><p>If <tt>⎕WX</tt> is 3 (2<sup>nd</sup> bit is also set) COM and .Net objects adopt the Version 11 behaviour, as opposed to the behaviour in previous versions of Dyalog APL.</p><p>Note that it is the value of <tt>⎕WX</tt> in the object itself, rather than the value of <tt>⎕WX</tt> in the calling environment, that determines its behaviour.</p><p>The value of <tt>⎕WX</tt> in a clear workspace is defined by the default_wx parameter (see User Guide) which itself defaults to 3.</p><p><tt>⎕WX</tt> has namespace scope and may be localised in a function header. This allows you to create a utility namespace or utility function in which the exposure of objects is known and determined, regardless of its global value in the workspace.</p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
