On suspension of execution the state indicator is cut back to the statement containing the call to the locked function or operator.</li><li value="3">Both 1 and 2 apply. You can neither display the locked object nor suspend execution within it.</li></ol><p>Locks are additive, so that</p><pre>      1 ⎕LOCK'FOO' ⋄ 2 ⎕LOCK'FOO'     </pre><p>is equivalent to:</p><pre>      3 ⎕LOCK'FOO' </pre><p>A <tt>DOMAIN ERROR</tt> is reported if <tt>Y</tt> is ill-formed.</p><h4>Examples</h4><pre>      ⎕FX'r←foo' 'r←10'
