<body><h2><tt>R←⎕SVO Y</tt>Query Degree of Coupling </h2><p>This system function returns the current degree of coupling for one or more shared variables.</p><p><tt>Y</tt> is a character scalar, vector or matrix.  If it is a vector it contains a shared variable name and optionally its external name or surrogate separated from it by one of more blanks.</p><p>If <tt>Y</tt> is a scalar, it specifies a single 1-character name.  If <tt>Y</tt> is a matrix, each row of <tt>Y</tt> specifies a name and an optional external name as for the vector case.</p><p>If <tt>Y</tt> specifies a single name, the result <tt>R</tt> is a 1-element vector whose value 0, 1 or 2 indicates its current degree of coupling.  If <tt>Y</tt> specifies more than one name, <tt>R</tt> is a vector whose elements indicate the current degree of coupling of the variable specified by the corresponding row in <tt>Y</tt>.  A value of 2 indicates that the variable is fully coupled (via a warm or hot DDE link) with a shared variable in another APL workspace, or with a DDE item in another application.  A value of 1 indicates that you have offered the variable but there is no such connection, or that the second application rejected a warm link.  In this case, a transfer of data may have taken place (via a cold link) but the connection is no longer open.  A value of 0 indicates that the name is not a shared variable.</p><h4>Examples</h4><pre>      ⎕SVO 'X'
