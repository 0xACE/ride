<body><h2><tt>{R}←X ⎕STOP Y</tt>Set Stop </h2><p><tt>Y</tt> must be a simple character scalar or vector which is taken to be the name of a visible defined function or operator.  <tt>X</tt> must be a simple non-negative integer scalar or vector.  <tt>R</tt> is a simple integer vector of non-negative elements.  <tt>X</tt> identifies the numbers of lines in the function or operator named by <tt>Y</tt> on which a stop control is to be placed.  Numbers outside the range of line numbers in the function or operator (other than 0) are ignored.  The number 0 indicates that a stop control is to be placed immediately prior to exit from the function or operator.  If <tt>X</tt> is empty, all existing stop controls are cancelled.  The value of <tt>X</tt> is independent of <tt>⎕IO</tt>.</p><p><tt>R</tt> is a vector of the line numbers on which a stop control has been placed in ascending order.  The result is suppressed unless it is explicitly used or assigned.</p><h4>Examples</h4><pre>      ⊢(0,⍳10) ⎕STOP 'FOO'

      ⊢0 1 ⎕STOP'FOO'</pre><p>The effect of <tt>⎕STOP</tt> when a function or operator is invoked is to suspend execution at the beginning of any line in the function or operator on which a stop control is placed immediately before that line is executed, and immediately before exiting from the function or operator if a stop control of 0 is set.  Execution may be resumed by a branch expression.  A stop control interrupt (1001) may also be trapped - see <a href="trap.html#TrapEvent" class="MCXref_0">Trap Event </a>.</p><h4>Example</h4><pre>      ⎕FX'R←FOO' 'R←10'
