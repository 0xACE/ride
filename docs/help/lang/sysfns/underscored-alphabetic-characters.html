<body><h2><tt>R←⎕Ⓐ</tt>Underscored Alphabetic Characters</h2><p><tt>⎕Ⓐ</tt> is a deprecated feature. Dyalog <b>strongly</b> recommends that you move away from the use of <tt>⎕Ⓐ</tt>and of the underscored alphabet itself, as these symbols now constitute the sole remaining non-standard use of characters in Dyalog applications.</p><p>In Versions of Dyalog APL prior to Version 11.0, <tt>⎕Ⓐ</tt> was a simple character vector, composed of the letters of the alphabet with underscores. If the Dyalog Alt font was in use, these symbols displayed as additional National Language characters.</p><h4>Version 10.1 and Earlier</h4><pre>      ⎕Ⓐ
ⒶⒷⒸⒹⒺⒻⒼⒽⒾⒿⓀⓁⓂⓃⓄⓅⓆⓇⓈⓉⓊⓋⓌⓍⓎⓏ</pre><p>For compatibility with previous versions of Dyalog APL, functions that contain references to <tt>⎕Ⓐ</tt> will continue to return characters with the same <span class="Italic">index</span> in <tt>⎕AV</tt> as before. However, the display of <tt>⎕Ⓐ</tt> is now <tt>⎕Á</tt>, and the old underscored symbols appear as they did in previous Versions when the Dyalog Alt font was in use.</p><h4>Current Version</h4><pre>      ⎕Á
