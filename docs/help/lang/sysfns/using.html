<body><h2><tt>⎕USING</tt>Using (Microsoft .Net Search Path) </h2><p><tt>⎕USING </tt>specifies a list of Microsoft .Net Namespaces that are to be searched for a reference to a .Net class.</p><p><tt>⎕USING</tt> is a vector of character vectors, each element of which specifies the name of a .Net Namespace followed optionally by a comma (<tt>,</tt>) and the Assembly in which it is to be found.</p><p>If a pathname is specified, the file is loaded from that location. Otherwise the system will attempt to load the assembly first from the directory in which the Dyalog program (or host application) is located, and then from the .Net installation directory.</p><p>If the Microsoft .Net Framework is installed, the System namespace in <span class="Code">mscorlib.dll</span> is automatically loaded when Dyalog APL starts. To access this namespace, it is not necessary to specify the name of the Assembly.</p><p><tt>⎕USING</tt> has <span class="Italic">namespace scope</span>. If the local value of <tt>⎕USING</tt> is anything other than empty, and you reference a name that would otherwise generate a <tt>VALUE ERROR</tt>, APL searches the list of .Net Namespaces and Assemblies specified by <tt>⎕USING</tt> for a class of that name. If it is found, an entry for the class is added to the symbol table in the current space and the class is used as specified. Note that subsequent references to that class in the current space will be identified immediately.</p><p>If <tt>⎕USING</tt> is empty (its default value in a <tt>CLEAR WS</tt>) no such search is performed.</p><p>Note that when you assign a value to <tt>⎕USING</tt>, you may specify a simple character vector or a vector of character vectors. If you specify a simple character vector (including an empty vector <tt>''</tt>), this is equivalent to specifying a 1-element enclosed vector containing the specified characters. Thus to clear <tt>⎕USING</tt>, you must set it to <tt>0⍴⊂''</tt> and not <tt>''</tt>.</p><h4>Examples:</h4><pre>  ⎕USING←'System'
