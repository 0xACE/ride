<body><h2><tt>⎕AVU</tt>Atomic Vector - Unicode </h2><p><tt>⎕AVU</tt> specifies the contents of the atomic vector, <tt>⎕AV</tt>, and is used to translate data between Unicode and non-Unicode character formats when required, for example when:</p><ul><li value="1">Unicode Edition loads or copies a Classic Edition workspace or a workspace saved by a Version prior to Version 12.0.</li><li value="2">Unicode Edition reads character data from a non-Unicode component file, or receives data type 82 from a TCP socket.</li><li value="3">Unicode Edition writes data to a non-Unicode component file</li><li value="4">Unicode Edition reads or writes data from or to a Native File using conversion code 82.</li><li value="5">Classic Edition loads or copies a Unicode Edition workspace</li><li value="6">Classic Edition reads character data from a Unicode component file, or receives data type 80, 160, or 320 from a TCP socket.</li><li value="7">Classic Edition writes data to a Unicode component file.</li></ul><p><tt>⎕AVU</tt> is an integer vector with 256 elements, containing the Unicode code points which define the characters in <tt>⎕AV</tt>.</p><h4>Note</h4><p>In Versions of Dyalog prior to Version 12.0 and in the Classic Edition, a character is stored internally as an index into the atomic vector, <tt>⎕AV</tt>. When a character is displayed or printed, the index in <tt>⎕AV</tt> is translated to a number in the range 0-255 which represents the index of the character in an Extended ASCII font. This mapping is done by the Output Translate Table which is user-configurable. Note that although ASCII fonts typically all contain the same symbols in the range 0-127, there are a number of different Extended ASCII font layouts, including proprietary APL fonts, which provide different symbols in positions 128-255. The actual symbol that appears on the screen or on the printed page is therefore a function of the Output Translate Table and the font in use. Classic Edition provides two different fonts (and thus two different <tt>⎕AV</tt> layouts) for use with the Development Environment, named <span class="Italic">Dyalog Std</span> (with APL underscores) and <span class="Italic">Dyalog Alt</span> (without APL underscores</p><p>The default value of <tt>⎕</tt><tt>AVU</tt> corresponds to the use of the <b>Dyalog Alt</b> Output Translate Table and font in the Classic Edition or in earlier versions of Dyalog APL.</p><pre>      2 13⍴⎕AVU[97+⍳26]

If you have been using Dyalog Alt for most things but have some older code which uses underscores, you can bring this code together in the same workspace and have it all look “as it should” by using the Alt and Std definitions for <tt>⎕AVU</tt> as you copy each part of the code into the same Unicode Edition workspace. </p><pre>      )COPY avu.dws Std.⎕AVU
