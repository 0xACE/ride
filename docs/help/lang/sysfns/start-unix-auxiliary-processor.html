<body><h2><tt>X ⎕SH Y</tt>Start UNIX Auxiliary Processor </h2><p>Used dyadically, <tt>⎕SH</tt> starts an Auxiliary Processor.  The effect, as far as the APL user is concerned, is identical under both Windows and UNIX although there are differences in the method of implementation.  <tt>⎕SH</tt> is a synonym of <tt>⎕CMD</tt>.  Either function may be used in either environment (UNIX or Windows) with exactly the same effect.  <tt>⎕SH</tt> is probably more natural for the UNIX user.  This section describes the behaviour of <tt>⎕SH</tt> and <tt>⎕CMD</tt> under UNIX.  See <a href="start-windows-auxiliary-processor.html#StartWindowsAuxiliaryProcessor" class="MCXref_0">Start Windows Auxiliary Processor </a> for a discussion of the behaviour of these system functions under Windows.</p><p><tt>X</tt> must be a simple character vector.  <tt>Y</tt> may be a simple character scalar or vector, or a nested character vector.</p><p><tt>⎕SH</tt> loads the Auxiliary Processor from the file named by <tt>X</tt> using a search-path defined by the environment variable <span class="Code">WSPATH</span>.</p><p>The effect of starting an AP is that one or more <b>external functions</b> are defined in the workspace.  These appear as locked functions and may be used in exactly the same way as regular defined functions.</p><p>When an external function is used in an expression, the argument(s) (if any) are <b>piped</b> to the AP for processing.  If the function returns a result, APL halts while the AP is processing and waits for the result.  If not it continues processing in parallel.</p><p>The syntax of dyadic <tt>⎕SH</tt> is similar to the UNIX execl(2) system call, where '<tt>taskname</tt>' is the name of the auxiliary processor to be executed and <tt>arg0</tt> through <tt>argn</tt> are the parameters of the calling line to be passed to the task, viz.</p><pre>      'taskname' ⎕SH 'arg0' 'arg1' ... 'argn'</pre><p>See <span class="Italic">User Guide</span> for further information.</p><h4>Examples</h4><pre>      'xutils' ⎕SH 'xutils' 'ss' 'dbr'
