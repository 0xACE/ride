<body><h2><tt>{R}←⎕FHOLD Y</tt>File Hold </h2><h4>Access code 2048</h4><p>This function holds component file(s) and/or external variable(s).</p><p>If applied to component files, then <tt>Y</tt> is an integer scalar, vector, or one-row matrix of file tie numbers, or a two-row matrix whose first row contains file tie numbers and whose second row contains passnumbers.</p><p>If applied to external variables, then <tt>Y</tt> is a non-simple scalar or vector of character vectors, each of which is the name of an external variable.  (NOT the file names associated with those variables).</p><p>If applied to component files <b>and</b> external variables, <tt>Y</tt> is a vector whose elements are either integer scalars representing tie numbers, or character vectors containing names of external variables.</p><p>The effect is as follows:</p><ol><li value="1">The user's preceding holds (if any) are released.</li><li value="2">Execution is suspended until the designated files are free of holds by any other task.</li><li value="3">When all the designated files are free, execution proceeds.  Until the hold is released, other tasks using <tt>⎕FHOLD</tt> on any of the designated files will wait.</li></ol><p>If <tt>Y</tt> is empty, the user's preceding hold (if any) is released, and execution continues.</p><p>A hold is released by any of the following:</p><ul><li value="1">Another <tt>⎕FHOLD</tt></li><li value="2">Untying or retying all the designated files.  If some but not all are untied or retied, they become free for another task but the hold persists for those that remain tied.</li><li value="3">Termination of APL.</li><li value="4">Any untrapped error or interrupt.</li><li value="5">A return to immediate execution.</li></ul><p>Note that a hold is not released by a request for input through <tt>⎕</tt> or <tt>⍞</tt>.</p><p>Note also that point 5 above implies that <tt>⎕FHOLD</tt> is generally useful only when called from a defined function, as holds set in immediate execution (desk calculator) mode are released immediately.</p><p>The shy result of <tt>⎕FHOLD </tt>is a vector of tie numbers of the files held.</p><h4>Examples:</h4><pre>      ⎕FHOLD 1
