<body><h2><tt>{R}←X ⎕MONITOR Y</tt>Set Monitor </h2><p><tt>Y</tt> must be a simple character scalar or vector which is taken to be the name of a visible defined function or operator.  <tt>X</tt> must be a simple non-negative integer scalar or vector.  <tt>R</tt> is a simple integer vector of non-negative elements.</p><p><tt>X</tt> identifies the numbers of lines in the function or operator named by <tt>Y</tt> on which a monitor is to be placed.  Numbers outside the range of line numbers in the function or operator (other than <tt>0</tt>) are ignored.  The number <tt>0</tt> indicates that a monitor is to be placed on the function or operator as a whole.  The value of <tt>X</tt> is independent of <tt>⎕IO</tt>.</p><p><tt>R</tt> is a vector of numbers on which a monitor has been placed in ascending order.  The result is suppressed unless it is explicitly used or assigned.</p><p>The effect of <tt>⎕MONITOR</tt> is to accumulate timing statistics for the lines for which the monitor has been set.  See <a href="query-monitor.html#QueryMonitor" class="MCXref_0">Query Monitor </a> for details.</p><h4>Examples</h4><pre>      +(0,⍳10) ⎕MONITOR 'FOO'
