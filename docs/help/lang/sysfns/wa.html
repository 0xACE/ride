<body><h2><tt>R←⎕WA</tt>Workspace Available </h2><p>This is a simple integer scalar.  It identifies the total available space in the active workspace area given as the number of bytes it could hold.</p><p>A side effect of using <tt>⎕WA</tt> is an internal reorganisation of the workspace and process memory, as follows:</p><ol><li value="1">Any un-referenced memory is discarded. This process, known as <span class="Italic">garbage collection</span>, is required because whole cycles of refs can become un-referenced.</li><li value="2">Numeric arrays are <span class="Italic">demoted</span> to their tightest form. For example, a simple numeric array that happens to contain only values 0 or 1, is demoted or <span class="Italic">squeezed</span> to have a <tt>⎕DR</tt> type of 11 (Boolean).</li><li value="3">All remaining used memory blocks are copied to the low-address end of the workspace, leaving a single free block at the high-address end. This process is known as <span class="Italic">compaction</span>.</li><li value="4">Workspace above a small amount (1/16 of the configured maximum workspace size) of working memory is returned to the Operating System. On a Windows system, you can see the process size changing by using Task Manager.</li></ol><h4>Example</h4><pre>      ⎕WA
