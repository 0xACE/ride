<body><h2><tt>{R}←{X}⎕SAVE Y</tt>Save Workspace </h2><p><tt>Y</tt> must be a simple character scalar or vector, identifying a workspace name. Note that the name must represent a valid file name for the current Operating System.    <tt>R</tt> is a simple logical scalar. The active workspace is saved with the given name in <tt>Y</tt>. In the active workspace, the value 1 is returned.  The result is suppressed if not used or assigned.</p><p>The optional left argument <tt>X</tt> is either 0 or 1. If <tt>X</tt> is omitted or 1, the saved version of the workspace has execution suspended at the point of exit from the <tt>⎕SAVE</tt> function.  If the saved workspace is subsequently loaded by <tt>⎕LOAD</tt>, execution is resumed, and the value 0 is returned if the result is used or assigned, or otherwise the result is suppressed. In this case, the latent expression value (<tt>⎕LX</tt>) is ignored.</p><p>If <tt>X</tt> is 0, the workspace is saved without any State Indicator in effect. The effect is the same as if you first executed <tt>)RESET</tt> and then <tt>)SAVE</tt>. In this case, when the workspace is subsequently loaded, the value of the latent expression (<tt>⎕LX</tt>) is honoured if applicable.</p><p>A <tt>DOMAIN ERROR</tt> is reported if the name in <tt>Y</tt> is not a valid workspace name or file name, or the reference is to an unauthorised directory.</p><p>As is the case for <tt>)SAVE</tt> (see <a href="../syscmds/save.html#SaveWorkspace" class="MCXref_0">Save Workspace </a>), monadic <tt>⎕SAVE</tt> will fail and issue <tt>DOMAIN ERROR</tt> if any threads (other than the root thread 0) are running or if there are any Edit or Trace windows open. However, neither of these restrictions apply if the left argument <tt>X</tt> is 0. </p><p>Note that the values of all system variables (including <tt>⎕SM</tt>) and all GUI objects are saved.</p><h4>Example</h4><pre>      (⊃'SAVED' 'ACTIVE' [⎕IO+⎕SAVE'TEMP']),' WS'
