<body><h2><tt>)HOLDS</tt>Display Held Tokens</h2><p>System command <tt>)HOLDS</tt> displays a list of tokens which have been acquired or requested by the <tt>:Hold</tt> control structure. </p><p>Each line of the display is of the form:</p><pre>token:  acq  req  req ...</pre><p>Where <tt>acq</tt> is the number of <span class="Italic">the</span> thread that has acquired the token, and <tt>req</tt> is the number of <span class="Italic">a</span> thread which is requesting it. For a token to appear in the display, a thread (and only one thread) must have acquired it, whereas any number of threads can be requesting it.</p><h4>Example</h4><p>Thread <tt>300</tt>’s attempt to acquire token <tt>'blue'</tt> results in a deadlock:</p><pre>300:DEADLOCK
