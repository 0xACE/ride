<body><h2><tt>)PCOPY {ws {nms}}</tt>Protected Copy </h2><p>This command brings all or selected global objects from a stored workspace with the given name provided that there is no existing global usage of the name in the active workspace.  A stored workspace is one which has previously been saved with the system command <tt>)SAVE</tt> or the system function <tt>⎕SAVE</tt>.</p><p><tt>)PCOPY</tt> does not copy <tt>⎕SM</tt>.  This restriction may be removed in a later release.</p><p>If the workspace name is not valid or does not exist or if access to the workspace is not authorised, the system reports "<tt>ws not found</tt>".  If the workspace name identifies a file that is not a workspace, or is a workspace with an invalid version number (one that is greater than the version of the current APL) the system reports "<tt>bad ws</tt>".  See  <a href="../intro/workspaces.html#Workspaces" class="MCXref_0">Workspaces</a> for the rules for specifying a workspace name.</p><p>If the workspace name is the name of a valid, readable workspace, the system reports the workspace name, "<tt>saved</tt>", and the date and time that the workspace was last saved.</p><p>If the list of names is excluded, all global defined objects (functions and variables) are copied.  If an object is not found in the stored workspace, the system reports "<tt>not found</tt>" followed by the name of the object. If an object cannot be copied into the active workspace because there is an existing referent, the system reports "<tt>not copied</tt>" followed by the name of the object.</p><p>For further information, see <a href="../sysfns/cy.html#CopyWorkspace:" class="MCXref_0">Example</a>.</p><h4>Examples</h4><pre>      )PCOPY WS/UTILITY
