<body><h2><tt>)SI</tt>State Indicator </h2><p>This command displays the contents of the state indicator in the active workspace.  The state indicator identifies those operations which are suspended or pendent for each suspension.</p><p>The list consists of a line for each suspended or pendent operation beginning with the most recently suspended function or operator.  Each line may be:</p><ul><li value="1">The name of a defined function or operator, followed by the line number at which the operation is halted, and followed by the <tt>*</tt> symbol if the operation is suspended. The name of the function or operator is its full pathname relative to the root namespace <tt>#</tt>. For example, <tt>#.UTIL.PRINT</tt>. In addition, the display of a function or operator which has dynamically changed space away from its origin is prefixed with its current space. For example, <tt>[⎕SE] TRAV</tt>.</li><li value="2">A primitive operator symbol.</li><li value="3">The Execute function symbol (<tt>⍎</tt>).</li><li value="4">The Evaluated Input symbol (<tt>⎕</tt>).</li><li value="5">The System Function <tt>⎕DQ</tt> or <tt>⎕SR</tt> (occurs when executing a callback function).</li></ul><h4>Examples</h4><pre>      )SI
#.PLUS[2]*
.
#.MATDIV[4]
#.FOO[1]*
⍎</pre><p>This example indicates that at some point function <tt>FOO</tt> was executed and suspended on line 1. Subsequently, function <tt>MATDIV</tt> was invoked, with a function derived from the Inner Product or Outer Product operator (<tt>.</tt>) having defined function <tt>PLUS</tt> as an operand.</p><p>In the following, function <tt>foo</tt> in namespace <tt>x</tt> has called <tt>goo</tt> in namespace <tt>y</tt>. Function<tt> goo</tt> has then changed space (<tt>⎕CS</tt>) to namespace <tt>z</tt> where it has been suspended:</p><pre>      )si
[z] y.goo[2]*
x.foo[1]</pre><h4>Threads</h4><p>In a multithreading application, where parent threads spawn child threads, the state indicator assumes the structure of a branching tree. Branches of the tree are represented by indenting lines belonging to child threads. For example:</p><pre>      )SI
·   #.Calc[1]
&amp;5
·   ·   #.DivSub[1]
·   &amp;7
·   ·   #.DivSub[1]
·   &amp;6
·   #.Div[2]*
&amp;4
#.Sub[3]
#.Main[4]</pre><p>Here, <tt>Main</tt> has called <tt>Sub</tt>, which has spawned threads <tt>4</tt> and <tt>5</tt> with functions: <tt>Div</tt> and <tt>Calc</tt>. Function <tt>Div</tt>, after spawning <tt>DivSub</tt> in each of threads <tt>6</tt> and <tt>7</tt>, has been suspended at line [2].</p></body>
