<body><h3><a name="Restrictions"></a>Restrictions</h3><p>Currently <b>multi-line</b> Dynamic Functions can’t be typed directly into the session. The interpreter attempts to evaluate the first line with its trailing left brace and a <tt>SYNTAX ERROR</tt> results.</p><p>Dynamic Functions need not return a result. However even a non-result-returning expression will terminate the function, so you can’t, for example, call a non-result-returning function from the middle of a Dynamic Function.</p><p>You can trace a Dynamic Function <b>only</b> if it is defined on more than one line. Otherwise it is executed atomically in the same way as an execute (<tt>⍎</tt>) expression. This deliberate restriction is intended to avoid the confusion caused by tracing a line and seeing nothing change on the screen.</p><p>Dynamic Functions do not currently support <tt>⎕CS</tt>.</p><h4>Supplied Workspaces</h4><p>You can find more examples of dynamic functions and operators in workspaces in the <b>samples\dfns</b> directory.</p><p>DFNS.DWS - a selection of utility functions.</p><p>MIN.DWS - an example application.</p></body>
