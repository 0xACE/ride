<body><h2><a name="IdiomRecognition"></a>Idiom Recognition</h2><p><span class="Italic">Idioms </span>are commonly used expressions that are recognised and evaluated internally, providing a significant performance improvement.</p><p>For example, the idiom <tt>BV/⍳⍴A</tt> (where <tt>BV</tt> is a Boolean vector and <tt>A</tt> is an array) would (in earlier Versions of Dyalog APL) have been evaluated in 3 steps as follows:</p><ol><li value="1">Evaluate <tt>⍴A</tt> and store result in temporary variable <tt>temp1</tt> (<tt>temp1</tt> is just an arbitrary name for the purposes of this explanation)</li><li value="2">Evaluate <tt>⍳temp1</tt> and store result in temporary variable <tt>temp2</tt>.</li><li value="3">Evaluate <tt>BV/temp2 </tt></li><li value="4">Discard temporary variables</li></ol><p>In the current Version of Dyalog APL, the expression is recognised in its entirety and processed in a single step as if it were a single primitive function. In this case, the resultant improvement in performance is between 2 and 4.5.</p><p>Idiom recognition is precise; an expression that is almost identical but not exactly identical to an expression given in the <a href="idiom-list.html" class="MCXref_0">Idiom List</a> table will not be recognised.</p><p>For example, <tt>⎕AV⍳</tt> will be recognised as an idiom, but <tt>(⎕AV)⍳</tt> will not. Similarly, <tt>(,)/</tt> would not be recognized as the Join idiom.</p></body>
