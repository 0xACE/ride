<body><h2><a name="CanonicalRepresentation"></a>Canonical Representation</h2><p>Operations may be defined with the system function <tt>⎕FX</tt> (Fix) or by using the editor within definition mode. Applying <tt>⎕CR</tt> to the character array representing the name of an already established operation will produce its canonical representation. A defined operation is composed of lines.  The first line (line 0) is called the operation HEADER. Remaining lines are APL statements, called the BODY.</p><p>The operation header consists of the following parts:</p><ol><li value="1">its model syntactical form,</li><li value="2">an optional list of local names, each preceded by a semi-colon (<tt>;</tt>) character,</li><li value="3">an optional comment, preceded by the symbol <tt>⍝</tt>.</li></ol><p>Only the model is required. If local names and comments are included, they must appear in the prescribed order.</p></body>
