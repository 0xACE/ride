<body><h2><a name="Statements"></a>Statements</h2><p>A statement is a line of characters understood by APL.  It may be composed of:</p><ol start="1"><li value="1">a LABEL (which must be followed by a colon <tt>:</tt>), or a CONTROL STATEMENT (which is preceded by a colon), or both, </li><li value="2">an EXPRESSION (see <a href="../intro/expressions.html#Expressions" class="MCXref_0">Expressions</a>),</li><li value="3">a SEPARATOR (consisting of the diamond character <tt>⋄</tt> which must separate adjacent expressions),</li><li value="4">a COMMENT (which must start with the character <tt>⍝</tt>).</li></ol><p>Each of the four parts is optional, but if present they must occur in the given order except that successive expressions must be separated by <tt>⋄</tt>. Any characters occurring to the right of the first comment symbol (<tt>⍝</tt>) that is not within quotes is a comment.</p><p>Comments are not executed by APL. Expressions in a line separated by <tt>⋄</tt> are taken in left-to-right order as they occur in the line. For output display purposes, each separated expression is treated as a separate statement.</p><h4>Examples</h4><pre>      5×10
