<body><h2><a name="_Toc289343217"></a>Nested Classes</h2><p>It is possible to define <span class="Italic">Classes within Classes</span> (Nested Classes).</p><p>A Nested Class may be either <tt>Private</tt> or <tt>Public</tt>. This is specified by a :Access Statement, which must precede the definition of any Class contents. The default is <tt>Private</tt>.</p><p>A <tt>Public</tt> Nested Class is visible from outside its containing Class and may be used directly in its own right, whereas a <tt>Private</tt> Nested Class is not and may only be used by code inside the containing Class.</p><p>However, methods in the containing Class may return instances of Private Nested Classes and in that way expose them to the calling environment.</p><script src="../../../../help.js"></script></body>
