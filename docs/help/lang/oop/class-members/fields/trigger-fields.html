<body><h3><a name="TriggerFields"></a>Trigger Fields</h3><p>A field may act as a <a href="../../../defined-functions-and-operators/triggers/triggers.html">Trigger</a> so that a function may be invoked whenever the value of the Field is changed.</p><p>As an example, it is often useful for the Display Form of an Instance to reflect the value of a certain Field. Naturally, when the Field changes, it is desirable to change the Display Form. This can be achieved by making the Field a Trigger as illustrated by the following example.</p><p>Notice that the Trigger function is invoked both by assignments made within the Class (as in the assignment in <tt>ctor</tt>) and those made from outside the Instance.</p><pre>:Class MyClass
