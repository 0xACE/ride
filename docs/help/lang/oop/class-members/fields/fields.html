<body><h2><a name="_Toc289343212"></a>Fields</h2><p>A Field behaves just like an APL variable.</p><p>To get the value of a Field, you reference its name; to set the value of a Field, you assign to its name. Conceptually, the Field value is stored <span class="Italic">in</span> the Field. However, Fields differ from variables in that they possess characteristics that control their accessibility.</p><p>A Field may be declared anywhere in a Class script by a <tt>:Field</tt> statement. This specifies:</p><ul><li value="1">the name of the Field</li><li value="2">whether the Field is Public or Private</li><li value="3">whether the Field is Instance or Shared</li><li value="4">whether or not the Field is ReadOnly</li><li value="5">optionally, an initial value for the Field.</li></ul><p>Note that <a href="../../../defined-functions-and-operators/triggers/triggers.html">Triggers</a> may be associated with Fields. See <a href="trigger-fields.html"><a href="trigger-fields.html#TriggerFields" class="MCXref_0">Trigger Fields</a></a> for details.</p><script src="../../../../../help.js"></script></body>
