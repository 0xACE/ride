<body><h2><a name="_Toc289343214"></a>Properties</h2><p>A Property behaves in a very similar way to an ordinary APL variable. To obtain the value of a Property, you simply reference its name. To change the value of a Property, you assign a new value to the name.</p><p>However, <span class="Italic">under the covers</span>, a Property is accessed via a <span class="Italic">PropertyGet</span> function and its value is changed via a <span class="Italic">PropertySet</span> function. Furthermore, Properties may be defined to allow partial (indexed) retrieval and assignment to occur.</p><p>There are three types of Property, namely <span class="Italic">Simple</span>, <span class="Italic">Numbered</span> and <span class="Italic">Keyed</span>.</p><p>A <span class="Italic">Simple Property</span> is one whose value is accessed (by APL) in its entirety and re-assigned (by APL) in its entirety.</p><p>A <span class="Italic">Numbered Property</span> behaves like an array (conceptually a vector) which is only ever <span class="Italic">partially</span> accessed and set (one element at a time) via indices. The Numbered Property is designed to allow APL to perform selections and structural operations on the Property.</p><p>A <span class="Italic">Keyed Property</span> is similar to a Numbered Property except that its elements are accessed via arbitrary keys instead of indices.</p><p>The following cases illustrate the difference between Simple and Numbered Properties.</p><p>If Instance <tt>MyInst</tt> has a Simple Property <tt>Sprop</tt> and a Numbered Property <tt>Nprop</tt>, the expressions</p><pre>      X←MyInst.SProp
      X←MyInst.SProp[2]</pre><p>both cause APL to call the PropertyGet function to retrieve the entire value of <tt>Sprop</tt>. The second statement subsequently uses indexing to extract just the second element of the value.</p><p>Whereas, the expression:</p><pre>      X←MyInst.NProp[2]</pre><p>causes APL to call the PropertyGet function with an additional argument which specifies that only the second element of the Property is required. Moreover, the expression:</p><pre>      X←MyInst.NProp</pre><p>causes APL to call the PropertyGet function successively, for every element of the Property.</p><p>A Property is defined by a <tt>:Property ... :EndProperty</tt> section in a Class Script.</p><p>Within the body of a Property Section there may be:</p><ul><li value="1">one or more <tt>:Access</tt> statements which <b>must appear first</b> in the body of the Property.</li><li value="2">a single PropertyGet function.</li><li value="3">a single PropertySet function</li><li value="4">a single PropertyShape function</li></ul><p> </p></body>
