<body><h2><a name="_Toc289343211"></a>Class Members</h2><p>A Class may contain <span class="Italic">Methods</span>, <span class="Italic">Fields </span>and <span class="Italic">Properties</span> (commonly referred to together as <span class="Italic">Members</span>) which are defined within the body of the Class script or are inherited from other Classes.</p><p>Methods are regular APL defined functions, but with some special characteristics that control how they are called and where they are executed. D-fns may not be used as Methods.</p><p>Fields are just like APL variables. To get the Field value, you reference its name; to set the Field value, you assign to its name, and the Field value is stored <span class="Italic">in</span> the Field. However, Fields differ from variables in that they possess characteristics that control their accessibility.</p><p>Properties are similar to APL variables. To get the Property value, you reference its name; to set the Property value, you assign to its name. However, Property values are actually accessed via <span class="Italic">PropertyGet</span> and <span class="Italic">PropertySet</span> functions that may perform all sorts of operations. In particular, the value of a Property is not stored <span class="Italic">in</span> the Property and may be entirely dynamic.</p><p>All three types of member may be declared as <span class="Italic">Public</span> or <span class="Italic">Private</span> and as <span class="Italic">Instance</span> or <span class="Italic">Shared</span>.</p><p>Public members are visible from outside the Class and Instances of the Class, whereas Private members are only accessible from within.</p><p>Instance Members are unique to every Instance of the Class, whereas Shared Members are common to all Instances and Shared Members may be referenced directly on the Class itself.</p></body>
