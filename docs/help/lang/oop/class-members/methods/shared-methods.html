However, a Shared method that is called via an Instance does not have direct access to the Fields and Properties of that Instance.</p><p>Class <tt>Parrot</tt> has a <tt>Speak</tt> method that does not require any information about the current Instance, so may be declared as Shared.</p><pre>:Class Parrot:Bird
