<body><h2><a name="IncludingNamespaces"></a>Including Namespaces in Classes</h2><p>A Class may import methods from one or more plain Namespaces. This allows several Classes to share a common set of methods, and provides a degree of multiple inheritance.</p><p>To import methods from a Namespace <tt>NS</tt>, the Class Script must include a statement:</p><pre>:Include NS</pre><p>When the Class is fixed by the editor or by <tt>âŽ•FIX</tt>, all the defined functions and operators in Namespace <tt>NS</tt> are included as methods in the Class. The functions and operators which are brought in as methods from the namespace <tt>NS</tt> are treated exactly as if the source of each function/operator had been included in the class script at the point of the <tt>:Include</tt> statement. For example, if a function contains <tt>:Signature</tt> or <tt>:Access</tt> statements, these will be taken into account. Note that such declarations have no effect on a function/operator which is in an ordinary namespace.</p><p>D-fns and D-ops in <tt>NS</tt> are also included in the Class but as <span class="Italic">Private members</span>, because D-fns and D-ops may not contain <tt>:Signature</tt> or <tt>:Access</tt> statements. Variables and Sub-namespaces in <tt>NS</tt> are <b>not</b> included.</p><p>Note that objects imported in this way are not actually <span class="Italic">copied</span>, so there is no penalty incurred in using this feature. Additions, deletions and changes to the functions in <tt>NS</tt> are immediately reflected in the Class.</p><p>If there is a member in the Class with the same name as a function in <tt>NS</tt>, the Class member takes precedence and supersedes the function in <tt>NS</tt>.</p><p>Conversely, functions in <tt>NS</tt> will supersede members of the same name that are inherited from the Base Class, so the precedence is:</p><p><b>Class</b> supersedes</p><blockquote><p><b>Included Namespace</b>, supersedes</p></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p><b>Base Class</b></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Any number of Namespaces may be included in a Class and the <tt>:Include</tt> statements may occur anywhere in the Class script. However, for the sake of readability, it is recommended that you have <tt>:Include</tt> statements at the top, given that any definitions in the script will supersede included functions and operators.</p></body>
