<body><h2><a name="Destructors"></a>Destructors</h2><p>A <span class="Italic">Destructor</span> is a function that is called just before an Instance of a Class ceases to exist and is typically used to close files or release external resources associated with an Instance.</p><p>An Instance of a Class is destroyed when:</p><ul><li value="1">The Instance is expunged using <tt>⎕EX</tt> or <tt>)ERASE</tt>.</li><li value="2">A function, in which the Instance is localised, exits.</li></ul><p>But be aware that a destructor will also be called if:</p><ul><li value="1">The Instance is re-assigned (see below)</li><li value="2">The result of <tt>⎕NEW</tt> is not assigned (the instance gets created then immediately destroyed).</li><li value="3">APL creates (and then destroys) a new Instance as a result of a reference to a member of an <a href="empty-arrays-of-instances-how.html">empty Instance</a>. The destructor is called after APL has obtained the appropriate value from the instance and no longer needs it.</li><li value="4">The constructor function fails. Note that the Instance is actually created before the constructor is run (inside it), and if the constructor fails, the fledgling Instance is discarded. Note too that this means a destructor <span class="Italic">may</span> need to deal with a partially constructed instance, so the code may need to check that resources were actually acquired, before releasing them.</li><li value="5">On the execution of <tt>)CLEAR</tt>, <tt>)LOAD</tt>, <tt>⎕LOAD</tt>, <tt>)OFF</tt> or <tt>⎕OFF</tt>.</li></ul><p>Note that an Instance of a Class only disappears when the <span class="Italic">last reference</span> to it disappears. For example, the sequence:</p><pre>      I1←⎕NEW MyClass
      I2←I1
      )ERASE I1</pre><p>will not cause the Instance of <tt>MyClass</tt> to disappear because it is still referenced by <tt>I2</tt>.</p><p>A Destructor is identified by the statement <tt>:Implements Destructor</tt> which must appear immediately after the function header in the Class script.</p><pre>:Class Parrot

This Parrot is dead</pre><p>If a Class inherits from another Class, the Destructor in its Base Class is automatically called after the Destructor in the Class itself.</p><p>So, if we have a Class structure:</p><pre>      DomesticParrot =&gt; Parrot =&gt; Bird</pre><p>containing the following Destructors:</p><pre>:Class DomesticParrot: Parrot
