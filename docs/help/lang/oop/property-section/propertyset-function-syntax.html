<body><h2><tt>Set ipa</tt>PropertySet Function</h2><p>The name of the PropertySet function must be <tt>Set</tt>, but is case-independent. For example, <tt>set</tt>, <tt>Set</tt>, <tt>sEt</tt> and <tt>SET</tt> are all valid names for the PropertySet function.</p><p>The PropertySet function must be monadic and may not return a result.</p><p><tt>ipa</tt> is an instance of the internal class <a href="propertyarguments-class.html">PropertyArguments</a>.</p><p>In all cases, <tt>ipa.Name</tt> contains the name of the Property being referenced and <tt>NewValue</tt> contains the new value(s) for the element(s) of the Property being assigned.</p><p>If the Property is <span class="Italic">Simple</span>, <tt>ipa.Indexers</tt> is undefined (<tt>VALUE ERROR</tt>).</p><p>If the Property is <span class="Italic">Numbered</span>, <tt>ipa.Indexers</tt> is an integer vector of the same length as the rank of the property (as implied by the result of the <tt>Shape</tt> function) that identifies a single element of the Property whose value is to be set. </p><p>If the Property is Keyed, <tt>ipa.IndexersSpecified</tt> is a Boolean vector with the same length as the rank of the property  (as implied by the result of the <tt>Shape</tt> function). A value of 1 means that an indexing array for the corresponding dimension of the Property was specified, while a value of 0 means that the corresponding dimension was elided.<tt>ipa.Indexers</tt> is a vector containing the arrays that were specified within the square brackets in the assignment expression. Specifically, <tt>ipa.Indexers</tt> will contain one fewer elements than, the number of semi-colon (;) separators. If any index was elided, the corresponding element of <tt>ipa.Indexers</tt> is <tt>âŽ•NULL</tt>. However, if the Keyed Property is being assigned in its entirety, without square-bracket indexing, <tt>ipa.Indexers</tt> is undefined (<tt>VALUE ERROR</tt>).</p></body>
