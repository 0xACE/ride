<body><h2><tt>R‚ÜêShape {ipa}</tt>PropertyShape Function</h2><p>The name of the PropertyShape function must be <tt>Shape</tt>, but is case-independent. For example, <tt>shape</tt>, <tt>Shape</tt>, <tt>sHape</tt> and <tt>SHAPE</tt> are all valid names for the PropertyShape function.</p><p>A PropertyShape function is only called if the Property is a Numbered Property.</p><p>The PropertyShape function must be niladic or monadic and must return a result.</p><p>If monadic, <tt>ipa</tt> is an instance of the internal class <a href="propertyarguments-class.html">PropertyArguments</a>. <tt>ipa.Name</tt> contains the name of the Property being referenced and <tt>NewValue</tt> and <tt>Indexers</tt> are undefined (<tt>VALUE ERROR</tt>).</p><p>The result <tt>R</tt> must be an integer vector or scalar that specifies the <tt>rank</tt> of the Property. Each element of <tt>R</tt> specifies the length of the corresponding dimension of the Property. Otherwise, the reference or assignment to the Property will fail with <tt>DOMAIN ERROR</tt>.</p><p>Note that the result <tt>R</tt> is used by APL to check that the number of indices corresponds to the rank of the Property and that the indices are within the bounds of its dimensions. If not, the reference or assignment to the Property will fail with <tt>RANK ERROR</tt> or <tt>LENGTH ERROR</tt>.</p><script src="../../../../help.js"></script></body>
