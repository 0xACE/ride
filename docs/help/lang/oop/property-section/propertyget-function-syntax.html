<body><h2><tt>R←Get {ipa}</tt>PropertyGet Function</h2><p>The name of the PropertyGet function must be <tt>Get</tt>, but is case-independent. For example, <tt>get</tt>, <tt>Get</tt>, <tt>gEt</tt> and <tt>GET</tt> are all valid names for the PropertyGet function</p><p>The PropertyGet function must be result returning. For a Simple Property, it may be monadic or niladic. For a Numbered or Keyed Property it must be monadic.</p><p>The result <tt>R</tt> may be any array. However, for a Keyed Property, <tt>R</tt> must conform to the rank and shape specified by <tt>ipa.Indexers</tt> or be scalar.</p><p>If monadic, <tt>ipa</tt> is an instance of the internal class <a href="propertyarguments-class.html">PropertyArguments</a>.</p><p>In all cases, <tt>ipa.Name</tt> contains the name of the Property being referenced and <tt>NewValue</tt> is undefined (<tt>VALUE ERROR</tt>).</p><p>If the Property is <span class="Italic">Simple</span>, <tt>ipa.Indexers</tt> is undefined (<tt>VALUE ERROR</tt>).</p><p>If the Property is <span class="Italic">Numbered</span>, <tt>ipa.Indexers</tt> is an integer vector of the same length as the rank of the property (as implied by the result of the <tt>Shape</tt> function) that identifies a single element of the Property whose value is to be obtained. In this case, <tt>R</tt> must be scalar.</p><p>If the Property is Keyed, <tt>ipa.IndexersSpecified</tt> is a Boolean vector with the same length as the rank of the property  (as implied by the result of the <tt>Shape</tt> function). A value of 1 means that an indexing array for the corresponding dimension of the Property was specified, while a value of 0 means that the corresponding dimension was elided. <tt>ipa.Indexers</tt> is a vector of the same length  containing the arrays that were specified within the square brackets in the reference expression. Specifically, <tt>ipa.Indexers</tt> will contain one fewer elements than, the number of semi-colon (;) separators. If any index was elided, the corresponding element of <tt>ipa.Indexers</tt> is <tt>⎕NULL</tt></p><script src="../../../../help.js"></script></body>
