<body><h2><a name="Workspaces"></a>Workspaces</h2><p>APL expressions are evaluated within a workspace. The workspace may contain objects, namely classes, namespaces, operators, functions and variables defined by the user. APL expressions may include references to primitive operators, functions and variables provided by APL. These objects do not reside in the workspace, but space is required for the actual process of evaluation to accommodate temporary data. During execution, APL records the state of execution through the STATE INDICATOR which is dynamically maintained until the process is complete. Space is also required to identify objects in the workspace in the SYMBOL TABLE. Maintenance of the symbol table is entirely dynamic. It grows and contracts according to the current workspace contents.</p><p>Workspaces may be explicitly saved with an identifying name. The workspace may subsequently be loaded, or objects may be selectively copied from a saved workspace into the current workspace.</p><p>Under UNIX, workspace names must be valid file names, but are otherwise unrestricted. See your UNIX documentation for details.</p><p>Under Windows, Dyalog APL workspaces are stored in files with the suffix ".DWS". However, they are referred to from within APL by only the first part of the file name which must conform to Windows file naming rules. </p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
