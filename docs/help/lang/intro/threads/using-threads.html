<body><h3>Using Threads</h3><p>Put most simply, multithreading allows you to <span class="Italic">appear to</span> run more than one APL function at the same time, just as Windows (or UNIX) <span class="Italic">appears to</span> run more than one application at the same time. In both cases this is something of an illusion, although it does nothing to detract from its usefulness.</p><p>Dyalog APL implements an internal timesharing mechanism whereby it shares processing between threads. Although the mechanics are somewhat different, APL multithreading is rather similar to the multitasking provided by Windows. If you are running more than one application, Windows switches from one to another, allocating each one a certain <span class="Italic">time slice</span> before switching. At any point in time, only one application is actually running; the others are paused, waiting.</p><p>If you execute more than one Dyalog APL thread, only one thread is actually running; the others are paused. Each APL thread has its own State Indicator, or SI stack. When APL switches from one thread to another, it saves the current stack (with all its local variables and function calls), restores the new one, and then continues processing.</p></body>
