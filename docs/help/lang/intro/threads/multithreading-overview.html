<body><h3>Overview</h3><p>Dyalog APL supports multithreading - the ability to run more than one APL expression at the same time.</p><p>This unique capability allows you to perform background processing, such as printing, database retrieval, database update, calculations, and so forth while at the same time perform other interactive tasks.</p><p>Multithreading may be used to improve throughput and system responsiveness.</p><p class="Bold">A <span class="Italic">thread</span> is a strand of execution in the APL workspace. </p><p>A thread is created by calling a function <span class="Italic">asynchronously</span>, using the new primitive operator ‘spawn’: <span class="Italic">&amp;</span> or by the asynchronous invocation of a callback function.</p><p>With a traditional APL <span class="Italic">synchronous</span> function call, execution of the calling environment is paused, <span class="Italic">pendent</span> on the return of the called function. With an <span class="Italic">asynchronous</span> call, both calling environment and called function proceed to execute concurrently.</p><p>An asynchronous function call is said to start a new <span class="Italic">thread </span>of execution. Each thread has a unique <span class="Italic">thread number</span>, with which, for example, its presence can be monitored or its execution terminated.</p><p>Any thread can spawn any number of sub-threads, subject only to workspace availability. This implies a hierarchy in which a thread is said to be a <span class="Italic">child thread</span> of its <span class="Italic">parent thread</span>. The <span class="Italic">base thread</span> at the root of this hierarchy has thread number 0.</p><p>With multithreading, APL’s stack or state indicator can be viewed as a branching tree in which the path from the base to each leaf is a thread.</p><p>When a parent thread terminates, any of its children which are still running, become the children of (are ‘adopted’ by) the parent’s parent.</p><p>Thread numbers are allocated sequentially from 0 to 2147483647. At this point, the sequence ‘wraps around’ and numbers are allocated from 0 again avoiding any still in use. The sequence is reinitialised when a <tt>)RESET</tt> command is issued, or the active workspace is cleared, or a new workspace is loaded. A workspace may not be saved with threads other than the base thread: 0, running.</p><script src="../../../../help.js"></script></body>
