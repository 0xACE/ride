<body><h2><a name="ComponentFiles"></a>Component Files</h2><p>A component file is a data file maintained by Dyalog APL.  It contains a series of APL arrays known as components which are accessed by reference to their relative positions or component number within the file.  A set of system functions is provided to perform a range of file operations. (See<MadCap:conditionalText><span class="XRef">Language Reference: </span><span class="XRef">Component Files</span></MadCap:conditionalText><a href="../sysfns/sysfns-categorised.html#ComponentFiles" class="MCXref_0">Component Files</a>.) These provide facilities to create or delete files, and to read and write components.  Facilities are also provided for multi-user access including the capability to determine who may do what, and file locking for concurrent updates.  (See <span class="Name">User Guide</span>.)</p></body>
