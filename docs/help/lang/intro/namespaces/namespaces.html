	</pre><p>They provide the same sort of facility for workspaces as directories do for
filesystems. The analogy might prove helpful:</p><table><tr><th class="Left">Operation</th><th class="Left">Windows</th><th class="Left">Namespace</th></tr><tr><td>Create</td><td>MKDIR"apl""Dyalog"

                </tt></td></tr></table><h4>Namespaces bring a number of major benefits:</h4><p>They provide static (as opposed to dynamic) local names. This means that a
defined function can use local variables and functions which persist when it
exits and which are available next time it is called.</p><p>Just as with the provision of directories in a filing system, namespaces
allow us to organise the workspace in a tidy fashion. This helps to promote an
object oriented programming style.</p><h4>APL's traditional name-clash problem is ameliorated in several ways:</h4><ul><li value="1">Workspaces can be arranged so that there are many fewer names at each namespace level. This means that when copying objects from saved workspaces there is a much reduced chance of a clash with existing names. </li><li value="2">Utility functions in a saved workspace may be coded as a single namespace and therefore on being copied into the active workspace consume only a single name. This avoids the complexity and expense of a solution which is sometimes used in 'flat' workspaces, where such utilities dynamically fix local functions on each call.</li><li value="3">In flat APL, workspace administration functions such as <tt>WSDOC</tt> must share names with their subject namespace. This leads to techniques for trying to avoid name clashes such as using obscure name prefixes like <tt>'⍙⍙L1'</tt> This problem is now virtually eliminated because such a utility can operate exclusively in its own namespace.</li></ul><h4>The programming of GUI objects is considerably simplified.</h4><ul><li value="1">An object’s callback functions may be localised in the namespace of the object itself.</li><li value="2">Static variables used by callback functions to maintain information between calls may be localised within the object.</li></ul><p>This means that the object need use only a single name in its namespace.</p></body>
