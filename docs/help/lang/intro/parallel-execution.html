        </h2><p>If your computer has more than one cpu or is a multi-core processor, many scalar dyadic functions (<tt>÷ ≥ = ≤ ⍟ | ! ○ ∨ ∧</tt>) execute in parallel in separate system threads each running on a separate cpu or core, when the argument size exceeds a configurable limit, the parallel execution threshold.</p><p>For example, by default if you have a 4-cpu computer and execute an expression such as (<tt>A÷B</tt>) where <tt>A</tt> and/or <tt>B</tt> contain more than 32768 elements, Dyalog will start 4 separate threads running on the 4 separate cpus each performing the division on ¼ of the elements of the array(s) and simultaneously creating the corresponding ¼ of the result array. The threads are only started once, and reused for subsequent multi-threaded operations.</p><p>The maximum number of cpus to use can be controlled using <tt>1111⌶</tt>, and the parallel execution threshold) is changed using <tt>1112⌶</tt>. These "tuning" I-beams should be considered experimental, and may be changed or replaced by automated tuning in a future release.  (See <MadCap:conditionalText><span class="XRef">Language Reference: </span><span class="XRef"> Number of Threads</span> and <span class="XRef">Parallel Execution Threshold</span></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText><a href="../primops/number-of-threads.html#NumberofThreads" class="MCXref_0">Number of Threads</a> and <a href="../primops/parallel-execution-threshold.html#ParallelExecutionThreshold" class="MCXref_0">Parallel Execution Threshold</a></MadCap:conditionalText>)</p><p>Note that the functions (<tt>+ - ×</tt>) are NOT executed using multiple cpus. This is because a single cpu is able to perform these operations so fast that memory is barely able to keep up. Tests show that multi-threading on separate cpus does not increase the speed of these operations.</p></body>
