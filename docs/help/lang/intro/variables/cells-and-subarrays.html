<body><h2><a name="CellsSubarrays"></a>Cells and Sub-arrays</h2><p>Certain functions and operators operate on particular cells or sub-arrays of an array, which are identified and described as follows.</p><h4>K-Cells</h4><p>A <span class="Name">rank-k</span> cell or <span class="Name">k-cell</span> of an array are terms used to describe a sub-array on the last <tt>k</tt> axes of the array. Negative <tt>k</tt> is interpreted as <tt>r+k</tt> where <tt>r</tt> is the rank of the array, and is used to describe a sub-array on the leading <tt>|k</tt> axes of an array.</p><p>If <tt>X</tt> is a 3-dimensional array of shape 2 3 4, the 1-cells are its 6 rows each of 4 elements; and its 2-cells are its 2  matrices each of shape 3 4. Its 3-cells is the array in its entirety. Its 0-cells are its individual elements.</p><h4>Major Cells</h4><p>The<span class="Name"> major cells</span> of an array <tt>X</tt> is a term used to describe the sub-arrays on the leading dimension of the array <tt>X</tt> with shape <tt>1↓⍴X</tt>. Using the k-cell terminology, the major cells are its <tt>¯1</tt>-cells.</p><p>The major cells of a vector are its elements (0-cells). The major cells of a matrix are its rows (1-cells), and the major cells of a 3-dimensional array are its matrices along the first dimension (2-cells). </p><h4 class="ExampleNewPage">Examples</h4><p>In the following, the major cells of <tt>A</tt>  are 1979, 1990, 1997, 2007, and 2010; those of <tt>B</tt>  are <tt>'Thatcher'</tt> , <tt>'Major  </tt> ' , <tt>'Blair   </tt>' , <tt>'Brown   '</tt> ,  and <tt>'Cameron'</tt> ; and those of <tt>C</tt> are the four 2-by-3 matrices.</p><pre>      A

</pre><p> Using the k-cell terminology, if <tt>r</tt> is the rank of the array, its major cells are its  <tt>r-1</tt>-cells.</p><p>Note that if the right operand <tt>k</tt> of the Rank Operator <tt>⍤</tt> is negative, it is interpreted as <tt>0⌈r+k</tt>. Therefore the value <tt>¯1</tt> selects the major cells of the array.</p><script src="../../../../help.js"></script></body>
