<body><h2><tt>R←2401⌶Y</tt>Expose Root Properties</h2><p>This function is used to expose or hide Root Properties, Event and Methods.</p><p>If <tt>Y</tt> is 1, Root Properties, Events and Methods are exposed.</p><p>If <tt>Y</tt> is 0, no further Root Properties, Events or Methods are exposed; however any that have already been exposed will remain so.</p><p>This functionality is available in Windows versions by selecting or unselecting the <span class="Name">Expose Root Properties</span> MenuItem in the <span class="Name">Options</span> Menu in the Session. Note that deselecting this MenuItem only affects future references to Root Properties, Events or Methods.</p><p>This function is the only mechanism available under non-Windows versions of Dyalog APL; the state of this setting is saved in the workspace, and therefore cannot be controlled by an environment variable.</p><h4>Example</h4><pre>
