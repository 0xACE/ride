<body><h2><tt>R←4002⌶Y</tt>Reap Forked Tasks (UNIX only)</h2><p>Under UNIX, when a child process terminates, it signals to its parent that it has terminated and waits for the parent to acknowledge that signal. <tt>4002⌶</tt> is the mechanism to allow the APL programmer to issue such acknowledgements.</p><p><tt>Y</tt> must be a simple empty vector but is ignored.</p><p>The result <tt>R</tt> is a matrix containing the list of the newly-terminated processes which have been terminated as a result of receiving the acknowledgement, along with information about each of those processes as described below.</p><p><tt>R[;1]</tt> is the process ID (PID) of the terminated child</p><p><tt>R[;2]</tt> is <tt>¯1</tt> if the child process terminated normally, otherwise it is the signal number which caused the child process to terminate.</p><p><tt>R[;3]</tt> is <tt>¯1</tt> if the child process terminated as the result of a signal, otherwise it is the exit code of the child process </p><p>The remaining 15 columns are the contents of the <code>rusage</code> structure returned by the underlying <code>wait3()</code> system call. Note that the two <span class="code">timeval</span><span class="code">structs</span> are each returned as a floating point number.</p><p>The current <code>rusage</code> structure contains:</p><pre class="Code">struct rusage {<br />    struct timeval ru_utime; /* user time used */<br />    struct timeval ru_stime; /* system time used */<br />    long   ru_maxrss;        /* maximum resident set size */<br />    long   ru_ixrss;         /* integral shared memory size */<br />    long   ru_idrss;         /* integral unshared data size */<br />    long   ru_isrss;         /* integral unshared stack size */<br />    long   ru_minflt;        /* page reclaims */<br />    long   ru_majflt;        /* page faults */<br />    long   ru_nswap;         /* swaps */<br />    long   ru_inblock;       /* block input operations */<br />    long   ru_oublock;       /* block output operations */<br />    long   ru_msgsnd;        /* messages sent */<br />    long   ru_msgrcv;        /* messages received */<br />    long   ru_nsignals;      /* signals received */<br />    long   ru_nvcsw;         /* voluntary context switches */<br />    long   ru_nivcsw;        /* involuntary context switches */<br />};</pre><p><tt>4002⌶</tt> may return the PID of an abnormally terminated Auxiliary Processor; APL code should check that the list of processes that have been reaped is a superset of the list of processes that have been started.</p><h4>Example</h4><pre>     ∇ tryforks;pid;fpid;rpid
