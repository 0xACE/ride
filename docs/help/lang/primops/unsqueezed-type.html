<body><h2><tt>R←181⌶Y</tt>Unsqueezed Type</h2><p><tt>Y</tt> is any array.</p><p>The result <tt>R</tt> is an integer scalar containing an integer value which indicates the type of the array. For further information see <a href="../sysfns/data-representation-monadic.html#DataRepresentation(Monadic)" class="MCXref_0">Data Representation (Monadic)</a>.</p><p><tt>181⌶</tt> is functionally identical to monadic <tt>⎕DR</tt>, except that no attempt is made to squeeze the data into smaller data types. <tt>⎕DR</tt> always attempts to squeeze the data; <tt>181⌶</tt> does not, but if a workspace compaction occurs during execution of <tt>181⌶</tt>, the data may still be squeezed before the type is identified.</p><h4>Example</h4><pre>
