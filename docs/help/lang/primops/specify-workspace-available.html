<body><h2><tt>R←2002⌶Y</tt>Specify Workspace Available</h2><p>This function is identical to the system function <tt><a href="../sysfns/wa.html#WorkspaceAvailable">⎕WA</a></tt> except that it provides the means to specify the amount of memory <span class="MCTextPopup"><span class="MCTextPopupBody_0" style="display: none; ">The term memory here means virtual memory which includes memory mapped to disk.</span><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopupSpot_0" onclick="FMCTextPopup( event, this ); return false;" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super">1</a></span>  that is <span class="Italic">committed</span> for the workspace rather than have it assigned by the internal algorithm. Committed memory is memory that is allocated to a specific process and thereby reduces the amount of memory available for other applications.</p><p>Like <tt>⎕WA</tt>,  <tt>2002⌶</tt> compacts the workspace so that it occupies the minimum number of bytes possible, adds an <span class="Italic">extra amount</span>, and then de-commits all the remaining memory that it is currently using, allowing it to be allocated by the operating system for use by other applications. </p><p>The argument <tt>Y</tt> is an integer which specifies the size, in bytes, of this <span class="Italic">extra amount</span>.</p><p>The purpose of the <span class="Italic">extra amount</span> is to reduce the likelihood that APL will immediately have to ask the operating system to re-commit memory that it has just de-committed, something that would have a deleterious effect on performance. At the same time, if the <span class="Italic">extra amount</span> were to be excessively large, APL could  starve other applications of memory which itself could reduce the effective performance of the system. Whereas <tt>⎕WA</tt> calculates the size of the <span class="Italic">extra amount</span> using a simple internal algorithm,  <tt>2002⌶</tt> uses a value specified by the programmer.</p><p><tt>R</tt> is an integer which reports the size in bytes of the memory committed  for the workspace, and is the sum of the minimum amount required  by the workspace itself and the argument <tt>Y</tt>.</p><p>If the size of the committed workspace would be smaller than the minimum value (specified by <tt>2000⌶</tt>) or larger than the maximum value (which defaults to <span class="Code">MAXWS</span>), a <tt>DOMAIN ERROR</tt> is signalled.</p><p>See also <a href="memory-manager-statistics.html#MemoryManagerStatistics" class="MCXref_0">Memory Manager Statistics</a>.</p><p>Note that this function does not change the size of the <span class="Italic">extra amount</span> that will be applied subsequently by <tt>⎕WA</tt> or by an automatic compaction.</p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
