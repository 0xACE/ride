Core to APLCore (UNIX only)</h2><p> </p><p>This function is used to extract a workspace from a <span class="Code">core</span> file and convert it to an <span class="Code">aplcore</span>
 file. It may then be possible to recover objects from the <span class="Code">aplcore</span> file. For further assistance in this matter, please contact support@dyalog.com.</p><p><tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt> are character vectors that specify the names of the <span class="Code">core</span> file and <span class="Code">aplcore</span> file respectively.</p><p><span class="Code">Core</span> files differ between AIX and Linux, thus the APL used must be for the same UNIX.</p><p>A 64-bit APL can be used to extract a 32 bit <span class="Code">core</span> file but a 32-bit APL cannot be used to extract a 64-bit core file. The process maps the <span class="Code">core</span> file into memory so a low value of <span class="Parameter">MAXWS</span> may be appropriate if a 32-bit APL is being used; <b>mapped files use a separate area of the process's address space from that occupied by the workspace</b>. </p><p>This function relies on certain markers being present in the workspace, and will operate only on <span class="Code">core</span> files generated by Version 12.1 or higher dated after 4<sup>th</sup> July 2011.</p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
