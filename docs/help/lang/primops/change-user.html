<body><h2><tt>R←4001⌶Y</tt>Change User (UNIX only)</h2><p><tt>Y</tt> is a character vector that specifies a valid UNIX user name. The function changes the <span class="Italic">userid (uid)</span> and <span class="Italic">groupid (gid)</span> of the process to values that correspond to the specified user name.</p><p>Note that it is only possible to change the user name if the current user name is <span class="Italic">root</span> (uid=0).</p><p>This call is intended to be made in the child process after a fork <tt>(4000⌶⍬) </tt>in a process with an effective user id of <span class="Italic">root</span>. It can however be used in any APL process with an effective user id of <span class="Italic">root</span>.</p><p>If the operation is successful, <tt>R</tt> is the user name specified in <tt>Y</tt>.</p><p>If the operation fails, the function generates a <tt>FILE ERROR 1 Not Owner</tt> error.</p><p>If the argument to <tt>4001⌶</tt> is other than a non-empty simple character vector, the function generates a <tt>DOMAIN ERROR</tt>.</p><p>If the argument is not the name of a valid user the function generates a <tt>FILE ERROR 3 No such process</tt>.</p><p>If the argument is the same name as the current effective user, then the function returns that name, but has no effect.</p><p>If the argument is a valid name other than the name of the effective user id of the current process, and that effective user id is not root the function generates a <tt>FILE ERROR 1 Not owner</tt>.</p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
