<body><h2>FILE ACCESS ERROR CONVERTING</h2><p>When a new version of Dyalog APL is used, it may be that improvements to the component file system demand that the internal structure of component files must alter.  This alteration is performed by the interpreter on the first occasion that the file is accessed.  If the operating system file permissions deny the ability to perform such a restructure, this report is given. </p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
