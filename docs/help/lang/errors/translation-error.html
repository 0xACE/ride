<body><h2><tt>92</tt>TRANSLATION ERROR</h2><p>This report is given when the system cannot convert a character from Unicode to an Atomic Vector index or vice versa. Conversion is controlled by the value of  <tt>⎕AVU</tt>. Note that this error can occur when you<b> reference a variable</b> whose value has been obtained by reading data from a TCPSocket or by calling an external function. This is because in these cases the conversion to/from <tt>⎕AV</tt> is deferred until the value is used. </p></body>
