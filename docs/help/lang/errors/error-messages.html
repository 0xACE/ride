<body><h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>The error messages reported by APL are described in this section.  Standard APL messages that provide information or report error conditions are summarised in <a href="apl-errors.html#APLErrors" class="MCXref_0">APL Error Messages</a> and described later in alphabetical order.</p><p>APL also reports messages originating from the Operating System (WINDOWS or UNIX) which are summarised in <a href="os-errors.html#OSErrorMessages" class="MCXref_0">Typical Operating System Error Messages</a> and <a href="windows-errors.html#WindowsErrorMessages" class="MCXref_0">Windows Operating System Messages</a>.  Only those Operating System error messages that might occur through normal usage of APL operations are described here.  Other messages could occur as a direct or indirect consequence of using the Operating System interface functions <tt>⎕CMD</tt> and <tt>⎕SH</tt> or system commands <tt>)CMD</tt> and <tt>)SH</tt>, or when a non-standard device is specified for the system functions <tt>⎕ARBIN</tt> or <tt>⎕ARBOUT</tt>.  Refer to the WINDOWS or UNIX reference manual for further information about these messages.</p><p>Most errors may be trapped using the system variable <tt>⎕TRAP</tt>, thereby retaining control and inhibiting the standard system action and error report.  The table, <a href="../sysfns/trap.html#TrapEvents" title="Trappable Event Codes" alt="Trappable Event Codes">Trappable Event Codes</a> identifies the error code for trappable errors.  The error code is also identified in the heading block for each error message when applicable.</p><p>See <span class="Italic">User Guide</span> for a full description of the Error Handling facilities in Dyalog APL.</p></body>
