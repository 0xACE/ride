<body><h2>Temperature Converter Tutorial</h2><p>This tutorial illustrates how to go about developing a simple WPF application in Dyalog APL. It is functionally identical to the GUI tutorial example that illustrates how to develop a GUI application using the built-in Dyaog APL Grahical user Interface. See <span class="XRef">Interface Guide: </span><span class="XRef">GUI Tutorial</span>.</p><p>Like the GUI Tutorial, this is necessarily an elementary example, but illustrates the principles that are  involved. The example is a simple Temperature Converter.</p><p>The user may enter a temperature value in either Fahrenheit or Centigrade and have it converted to the other scale.</p><p>No attempt has been made to update the WPF example, in terms of its user-interface, from the original version which was developed for Windows 3. This allows a direct comparison to be made between using the WPF and using the built-in Dyalog GUI.</p><p>There are two versions provided. The first uses XAML to describe the user-interface with code to drive it. The second version is written entirely in APL code. The two versions of this example may be found in <span class="Code">WPFINtro.dws</span> in the namespaces <tt>UsingXAML</tt> and <tt>UsingCode</tt> respectively.</p></body>
