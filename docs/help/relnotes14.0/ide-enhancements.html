<body><h2>IDE Enhancements</h2><p>Two new User Commands, <span class="UserCommand">]boxing</span> and <span class="UserCommand">]rows</span> provide alternate forms of  displaying output in the Session. </p><h4 class="UserCommand"><a name="boxing_user_command"></a>]boxing</h4><p>The <span class="UserCommand">boxing</span> user command has the following arguments:</p><ul><li class="UserCommandArg" value="1">on</li><li class="UserCommandArg" value="2">off</li></ul><p>and the following modifiers:</p><ul><li value="1"><span class="UserCommandSwitch">-style</span> = <span class="UserCommandValue">min</span> | <span class="UserCommandValue">mid</span> | <span class="UserCommandValue">max</span></li><li value="2"><span class="UserCommandSwitch">-trains</span> = <span class="UserCommandValue">box</span> | <span class="UserCommandValue">tree</span> | <span class="UserCommandValue">parens</span></li><li value="3"><span class="UserCommandSwitch">-fns</span> = <span class="UserCommandValue">on</span> | <span class="UserCommandValue">off</span></li><li value="4"><span class="UserCommandSwitch">-chars</span> = <span class="UserCommandValue">regular</span> | <span class="UserCommandValue">chars</span></li></ul><p>If boxing is on,  arrays resulting from expressions entered in the Session are displayed  with a series of boxes bordering each sub-array. The  <span class="UserCommandSwitch">-style</span> modifier controls the amount of information provided in each border.  The <span class="UserCommandSwitch">-trains</span> modifer controls how function trains (see <a href="function-trains.html" class="MCXref_0">Function Trains</a>) are displayed. The  <span class="UserCommandSwitch">-fns</span> modifier controls whether or not boxing is applied to output generated within a function. The <span class="UserCommandSwitch">-chars</span> modifier selects the type of symbol used to draw the borders.</p><h4>Examples</h4><pre>      ]boxing

</pre><h4><a name="rows_user_command"></a>]rows</h4><p>The <span class="UserCommand">]rows</span> user command controls how rows in multi-row output to the Session are displayed. In place of the standard behaviour controlled by the <span class="Parameter"> auto-pw</span> parameter or
<tt>⎕PW</tt>, <span class="UserCommand">]rows</span> allows multi-row output to be truncated or wrapped to fit the Session window, or folded and cut.</p><h4><a name="Aligning_Comments"></a>Aligning Comments</h4><p>There is a new Editor command, AC, which is used to align comments in a function in an edit window.</p><p>When you press the &lt;AC&gt; key, or hit Align Comments in the Editor's context menu, the alignment of the comments in every line in the function will be changed so that the left-most comment (Lamp) symbol is in the same column as the cursor, except that:</p><ul><li value="1">Comment symbols that lie between the first column and the first tab stop will remain in or be moved to the first column. For information on setting tab stops, see <span class="XRef">Installation &amp; Configuration Guide: </span><span class="XRef">Configuration Dialog (Edit/Trace Tab)</span>.</li><li value="2">Comment symbols will not move further left than the end of the statement.</li></ul><p>When a comment is re-aligned, text to the right of the left-most comment symbol (including spaces and other comment symbols) will remain fixed in relation to  that symbol.</p><p>Note that there is no keystroke associated with this command by default; the user must define one. See <span class="XRef">Installation &amp; Configuration Guide: </span><span class="XRef">Configuration Dialog (Keyboard Shortcuts Tab)</span>.</p><h4><a name="New_Editor_Toolbar_Buttons"></a>New Editor Toolbar Buttons</h4><p><img src="../userguide/images/editor-toolbar.png" /></p><p>There are two new buttons on the Editor Toolbar whose functions are as follows:</p><table><tr><td class="IconTable"><img src="../userguide/images/editor-search-hidden-text-icon.png" /><br />Search hidden text</td><td class="IconTable">Specifies whether or not the search examines collapsed blocks</td></tr><tr><td class="IconTable"><img src="../userguide/images/editor-match-case-icon.png" /><br />Match case</td><td class="IconTable">Specifies whether or not the search is case-sensitive. This setting is shared with the case-sensitivity setting in the Find/Replace Tool</td></tr></table><h4><a name="New_Tracer_Options"></a>New Tracer Options</h4><p>There are two new options for the Tracer namely <span class="Name">Skip blank lines when tracing</span> and <span class="Name">Limit tracer display to function in script</span>, which are enabled or disabled using the  option buttons in the <span class="Name">Configuration Dialog: Trace/Edit Tab</span> as shown below.</p><p><img src="../userguide/images/configuration-dialog-trace-edit-tab.png" /></p><h4>Skipping comments and blank lines(SkipBlankLines parameter)</h4><p>This parameter causes the Tracer to automatically skip lines that contain no executable statement (i.e. blank lines and comment lines), with the exception of the first line in the function, and in the case of a traditional function (not a dfn), the last line if it is a comment.</p><h4>Limit tracer display to current function in script<br />(AddClassHeaders parameter)</h4><p>This parameter specifies what the Tracer displays when tracing the execution of a function in a script. If set to 1, the Tracer displays  just the first line of the script and the function in question. If set to 0,  the entire script is shown in the Tracer window.</p><h4><a name="New_Editor_Options"></a>New Editor Options</h4><h4>Remember previous Window position<br />(ClassicModeSavePosition parameter)</h4><p>This parameter specifies whether or not the current size and location of the first of the editor and tracer windows are remembered for next time. It applies only when Classic Mode is enabled.</p><p>The size and location of the windows are saved in the registry in the subfolder WindowRects/EditWindow and TraceWindow.</p><h4>Allow search to wrap<br />(WrapSearch parameter)</h4><p>This parameter specifies whether or not Search/Replace in the Editor stops at the bottom or top of the text (depending upon the direction of the search), or continues the search from the start or end as appropriate.</p><h4 class="Newpage">Editor, Tracer and scripted objects</h4><h4>Editor, Tracer and objects fixed in scripted objects</h4><p>A scripted object can be created either by using the Editor or by calling <tt>⎕FIX</tt>.</p><p>The source of a scripted object can be altered only using the Editor, or by refixing using <tt>⎕FIX</tt>. Dynamic changes to variables, fields and properties, and calling <tt>⎕FX</tt> to generate functions do not alter the source of a scripted object. This behaviour has not changed since the introduction of scripted objects, and does not change in Version 14.0.</p><p>Prior to Version 14.0, <tt>⎕FX</tt>ing a function in a scripted object lead to apparent anomalies when tracing and editing such functions - the Tracer and Editor displayed the version of the function that was part of the source of the scripted object even though the <tt>⎕FX</tt>ed function was the version of the function that was being executed.</p><p>Now both the Tracer and the Editor display the <tt>⎕FX</tt>ed function; the statusfield will contain either "Unscripted function" or "Unscripted operator". In addition, if a function is in the source of a scripted object, the Editor and Tracer windows will display the whole script (possibly in a collapsed state) whereas a <tt>⎕FX</tt>ed function will display in a window on its own.</p><p>This behaviour is true when calling <tt>⎕FIX</tt>ed in scripted object too.</p><p>A scripted object can be created either by using the Editor or by calling <tt>⎕FIX</tt>.</p><h4>Change to fixing scripted objects in the Editor</h4><p>In Version 14.0, when fixing a scripted object from within the Editor, only objects that have changed will be refixed; in earlier Versions all objects would have been refixed.</p><p>In Versions prior to 14.0 adding or removing a Stop on a line in a function in a scripted object would have lead to the function being refixed. This is no longer true.</p></body>
