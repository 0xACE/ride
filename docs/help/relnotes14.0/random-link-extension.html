<body><h2>Random Link Extension</h2><p>Certain applications require a non-repeatable series of pseudo-random numbers, and several programming techniques exist to meet this requirement (such as generating a seed from the system clock) which are not always satisfactory. In Version 14.0, you may have the system itself generate a random seed by assigning the value 0 to <tt>⎕RL</tt>.</p><p>If<tt> ⎕RL</tt> is assigned the value 0, <tt>⎕RL</tt> is initialised with a random seed generated by the operating system. This provides the means to initiate a non-repeatable series of pseudo-random numbers when using <span class="Name">RNG0</span> or <span class="Name">RNG1</span>.</p></body>
