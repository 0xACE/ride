<body><h3>Redraw Property</h3><p>The Redraw Property has been extended; setting the Property to a value of 3 causes the object and all of its children to be redrawn immediately. As in previous versions of Dyalog APL, a value of 2 causes the object to be redrawn immediately, but not its children.</p></body>
