<body><h2><a name="Announcements"></a>Announcements</h2><h4><a name="Support_12.1"></a>Withdrawal of Support for Version 12.1 and 13.0</h4><p>The supported Versions of Dyalog APL are now Version 14.0, Version 13.2 and Version 13.1. Versions 13.0, 12.1 and earlier are no longer supported. </p><h4>Migration Level (<tt>⎕ML</tt>)</h4><p>In Version 14.0, the default value of<tt> ⎕ML</tt> in a <tt>CLEAR WS</tt> has been changed from 0 to 1. This means that monadic <tt>∊</tt> is interpreted as Enlist and not as Type. Note that the value of <tt>⎕ML</tt> in saved workspaces is unaffected by this change. Note too that this default value may be overridden using the <span class="Parameter">default_ml</span> parameter. See User Guide for details.</p><h4><a name="Deprecated_Small_Span_Component_Files"></a>Deprecation of small-span component files</h4><p>Since Version 10.1, Dyalog APL has supported large-span (64-bit) component files, and since Version 12.0 <tt>⎕FCREATE</tt> has created these by default. </p><p>From Version 14.0 onwards it is not possible to create small-span component files, although you may continue to read and write components on existing small-span component files.</p><p>Dyalog recommends that you convert any existing small-span component files to large-span files using <tt><a href="../lang/sysfns/fcopy.html">⎕FCOPY</a></tt>. <tt><a href="../lang/sysfns/fcopy.html">⎕FCOPY</a></tt> will create a large-span copy even if the file being copied is small-span. You may use the  user command <tt>]Files.tolarge</tt> to locate existing small-span files and convert them to the large-span architecture.</p><p>Dyalog APL now ignores the <span class="Name">-F32</span> argument, as well as the <span class="NoHyphenate">APL_FCREATE_PROPS_S</span> environment variable.</p><h4><a name="Deprecated_Auxiliary_Processors"></a>Auxiliary Processors</h4><p>In Version 14.0, the Dyalog-supplied Auxiliary Processor <span class="Code">qfsck</span> has been removed from the product. Anybody still using <code>fsck</code> is advised to switch to  <tt>⎕FCHK</tt> instead.</p><p>The auxiliary processors <span class="Code">strand</span> and <span class="Code">xutils</span> are still included with Version 14.0, but the intention remains to remove them as soon as possible.</p><p>The interfaces for user-written Auxiliary Processors will continue to be supported. </p><h4><a name="Random_Number_Generator">Random Number Generator</a></h4><p>In Versions 13.1 and 13.2 the default random number generator in a <tt>CLEAR WS</tt> was 0 (Lehmer linear congruential). </p><p>In Version 14.0 the default is 1 (Mersenne Twister). </p><p>Note: the change to the default will only impact applications if they are rebuilt from a clear workspace; saved workspaces will be unaffected.</p><h4><a name="Component_Files_Recommendation"></a>Recommendation concerning Component Files</h4><p>Dyalog strongly recommends that Component files should be protected by Journalling and have Checksum enabled. See <a href="../lang/sysfns/fprops.html#FileProperties:" class="MCXref_0">Access Code 1 (to read) or 8192 (to change properties)</a>.</p><h4><a name="FontObj_Property"></a>FontObj Property</h4><p>The FontObj property should no longer be used directly to specify the properties of a font. It should only be used to specify the Font object to be used, which in turn specifies the characteristics of a font.</p><h4><a name="Carriage_Return_Character"></a>Carriage Return Change (UNIX only)</h4><p>Previously, the expression <tt>⎕UCS ⎕AV[3+⎕IO]</tt>  returned 133 (NEL) in Unicode UNIX  versions. In all other versions it returned 13 (CR).</p><p>From Version 14.0, all versions of Dyalog APL return 13. </p><p>Note: the change to the default will only impact applications if they are rebuilt from a clear workspace; saved workspaces will be unaffected.</p><h4><a name="Net_Support"></a>.NET Support</h4><p>Support for Microsoft .Net Version 2 will cease in Dyalog APL Version 15.0.</p><h4>New Method</h4><p>Currently Dyalog APL adds a method named <span class="Name">New</span> to all .Net objects which do not have such a member. This allows the APL programmer to create an instance of an object (such as in this example a DateTime object) by executing the statements:</p><pre>       ⎕USING←'System'
      dt←DateTime.New 1949 4 30</pre><p>Dyalog intends to remove this feature from future versions of Dyalog APL. This mechanism was made redundant by the introduction of  <tt>⎕NEW</tt>, and the following syntax should be adopted:</p><pre>      dt←⎕NEW DateTime (1949 4 30)</pre><h4>UpperCase Property</h4><p>Dyalog intends to remove the Uppercase Property as a property of Root in future versions of Dyalog APL. Since Version 12.0 its value  has had no effect.</p><p> </p><h4>
		Dyalog-added .New method</h4><p>In Version 14.0 and prior the interpreter would add a .New method to any .NET object which did not have one of its own. This was introduced when ⎕NEW was not part of the language. From Version 14.1 onwards the interperter will no longer add a .New method.</p><p> </p><h4>
            DWSIN/DWSOUT</h4><p>The workspaces <tt>DWSIN</tt> and <tt>DWSOUT</tt> have been removed from version 14.0; <tt>]in</tt> and <tt>]out</tt> should be used instead. More details can be found in the <span class="Name">Dyalog APL Workspace Transfer Guide</span>.</p><script src="../../help.js"></script></body>
