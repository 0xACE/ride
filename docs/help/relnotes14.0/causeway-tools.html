<body><h2>Causeway Tools</h2><h4>Overview  </h4><p>SharpPlot has been available for about ten years as a direct replacement for  RainPro. It is a  conversion of the original APL code into compiled C++ and provides all of the original functionality and more.</p><p>SharpPlot is shipped in two forms : </p><ul><li value="1"><span class="Code">sharpplot.dll</span> : a Microsoft .Net assembly for Windows, which may also be run on Unix platforms using <span class="Name">Mono</span><span class="MCTextPopup"><span class="MCTextPopupBody_0" style="display: none; ">Mono is an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET Framework.For more information, see www.mono-project.com.</span><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopupSpot_0" onclick="FMCTextPopup( event, this ); return false;" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super">1</a></span>.</li><li value="2"><span class="Code">sharpplot.dws</span> : a Dyalog APL workspace that permits SharpPlot to be used on platforms other than .Net.</li></ul><p> Dyalog recommends upgrading from RainPro to SharpPlot as soon as possible, for a number of reasons :</p><ul><li value="1"> It has a more consistent API, and clearer documentation</li><li value="2">It supports more advanced graphics features such as alpha blending and anti-aliased raster graphics.</li><li value="3"> It provides better performance (SharpPlot is consistently several times faster than RainPro).</li><li value="4">It provides multi-platform support (RainPro is supported only on windows)</li><li value="5"> It includes free support for licensed users, including requests for enhancements</li></ul><p> RainPro is still supported on Windows platforms, and bugs will be fixed for commercial users.</p><h4>   RainPro-to-SharpPlot Transition : SharpRain.dws </h4><p> SharpRain is a transition tool designed to help Windows users to switch from RainPro to SharpPlot. It is a compatible emulator for RainPro/APL scripts, using SharpPlot/.Net as the backend, and provides better graphics and better performance (generally twice as fast as RainPro).</p><p>In addition, it can convert a RainPro script into a SharpPlot script, which will provide further performance improvement (generally 5 to 10 times faster than RainPro)</p><p>Further details are provided in  <span class="Code">sharprain.dws</span>.</p><h4>     Multi-Platform graphics</h4><p>In Version14.0, SharpPlot is also shipped as an APL workspace (<span class="Code">SharpPlot.dws</span>), which will run on all platforms supported by Dyalog.</p><p>Raster graphics and custom fonts are not supported, and the API is slightly different from the .Net version. In particular, Properties are accessed through Get*/Set* functions rather than through a variable. These functions provide greater flexibility in terms of the arguments they will accept.</p><p> Further details are provided in <span class="Code">SharpPlot.dws</span>.</p><p>  The <span class="Code">SharpPlot.dll</span> .Net assembly can still be used on non-Windows platform through <span class="Name">Mono</span>. </p><h4> Chart Wizard</h4><p>The chart wizard is a GUI tool to produce arbitrarily complex SharpPlot charts.</p><p>It is implemented by the <tt>]chart</tt>
user command, which takes an APL expression as its argument. The chart wizard will then produce either the chart image, or a script that will generate the ssame image, for integration into user application.</p><p>Sessions can also be saved and loaded for complex chart elaboration.</p><script src="../../help.js"></script></body>
