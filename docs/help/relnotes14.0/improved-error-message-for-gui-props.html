      'F'⎕WC'Form'('Posn' 10 10)('TheCaption' 'andys')
     ∧</pre><p>This was confusing because the statement contains no mention of the Size property. </p><p>The system will now generate the following error:</p><pre>RANK ERROR: There was an error processing the property at position 2 of the right argument
