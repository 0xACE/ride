In Unicode Edition, only the correct symbols may be used; the substitution strings will not be understood.</p><table style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><th class="Left">Symbol</th><th class="Left">Substitution String (Classic Edition only)</th></tr><tr><td><tt>⍠</tt></td><td><tt>⎕U2360</tt></td></tr><tr><td><tt>⌸</tt></td><td><tt>⎕U2338</tt></td></tr><tr><td><tt>⍤</tt></td><td><tt>⎕U2364</tt></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Replacement of these symbols with their substitution strings and vice versa will only occur when they appear in code in the body of functions which appear in non-scripted namespaces. Replacement will not happen when they appear in:</p><ul><li value="1">comments in functions</li><li value="2">character constants in functions</li><li value="3">any scripted object (this includes functions defined in scripted objects)</li><li value="4">variables </li></ul><p>When attempting to <tt>)LOAD</tt> or <tt>)COPY</tt> a workspace  that does not meet the above criteria into a Classic Edition, a <tt>TRANSLATION ERROR</tt> will be signalled. In 14.0 the error message includes the character which has caused the operation to fail; bear in mind that this is the first occurrence of the first character which will generate a <tt>TRANSLATION ERROR</tt>; there may be more instances of this character, and there may be other characters too.</p><script src="../../help.js"></script></body>
