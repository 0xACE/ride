<body><h2>File Read</h2><p><tt>⎕FREAD</tt> has been enhanced to allow you to read several components at one time, without the use of the Each (<tt>¨</tt>) operator. It differs from the equivalent operation using Each in that it is faster and is an atomic operation that does not permit an intervening file operation by a different user. </p><p>To effect this enhancement, the second element of the argument may now be a vector of component numbers, rather than just a single component number as before.</p><h4>Example</h4><pre>      'temp'⎕FCREATE 1
