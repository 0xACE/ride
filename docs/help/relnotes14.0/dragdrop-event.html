<body><h3>DragDrop Event</h3><p>The DragDrop Event used to always report the <span class="Italic">name</span> of the dragged object in the event message regardless of the syntax used to specify the callback function.</p><p>Henceforth, if the callback function is specified using the <tt>onDragDrop</tt> syntax, the 3<sup>rd</sup> element of the event message is a <span class="Name">ref </span>to the dragged object rather than its name. If you use the Event property to establish the callback, the 3<sup>rd</sup> element of the event message is the name of the object as before. </p><p>This change makes the DragDrop event consistent with other events in the way that objects are reported in the event message.</p><script src="../../help.js"></script></body>
