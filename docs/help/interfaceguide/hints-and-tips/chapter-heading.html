It is conventional to do this by displaying a message when the user points to a control with the mouse. The provision of this facility is particularly helpful for users who are not familiar with your application or who use it only occasionally. Constant prompting can however become irritating for an experienced user, so it is a good idea to provide a means to disable it.</p><p>Dyalog APL/W provides two mechanisms, <span class="Italic">hints</span> and <span class="Italic">tips</span>, that make the provision of context-sensitive help very easy and efficient to implement. <b>Hints</b> are help messages displayed in a fixed region, typically a field in a status bar, that is reserved for the purpose. For example, when the user browses through a menu, a message describing each of the options may be displayed in the status bar. The user has only to glance at the status bar to obtain guidance. <b>Tips</b> are similar, but instead of being displayed in a fixed location, they are displayed as pop-up messages over the control to which they refer. The choice of using hints or tips is a matter of taste and indeed many applications feature both.</p></body>
