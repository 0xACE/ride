<body><h2><a name="Fonts"></a>Fonts</h2><p>In keeping with the manner in which fonts are managed by Microsoft Windows and other GUI environments, Dyalog APL treats fonts as objects which you create (load) using <tt>⎕WC</tt> and erase (unload) using <tt>⎕EX</tt> or localisation.</p><p>A Font <b>object</b> is created and assigned a name using <tt>⎕WC</tt>. This name is then referenced by other objects via their FontObj <b>properties</b>. For example to use an Arial bold italic font of height 32 pixels in two Labels:</p><pre>     'A32' ⎕WC 'Font' 'ARIAL' 32 0 1 0 700
 
     'F.L1' ⎕WC 'Label' 'Hello' (20 10) ('FontObj' 'A32')
     'F.L2' ⎕WC 'Label' 'World' (20 10) ('FontObj' 'A32')</pre><p>If a font is referenced by more than one Form, you should create the Font as a top-level object, as in the above example. However, if the font is referenced by a single Form, you may make the Font object a child of that Form. The font will then automatically be unloaded when you erase the Form with which it is associated.</p><p><b>Compatibility </b><b>Note:</b></p><p>In the first release of Dyalog APL/W (Version 6.2), fonts were referenced <b>directly</b> by the FontObj property. The above example would have been achieved by:</p><pre>      'F.L1' ⎕WC 'Label' 'Hello' (10 10)
                 ('FontObj' 'ARIAL' 32 0 1 0 700)
 
      'F.L2' ⎕WC 'Label' 'World' (20 10)
                 ('FontObj' 'ARIAL' 32 0 1 0 700)</pre><p>Although this original mechanism continues to be supported, it is recommended that you use the method based on Font <b>objects</b> which supersedes it.</p></body>
