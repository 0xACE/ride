<body><h2><a name="Host_Service_Names"></a>Host and Service Names</h2><p>Although basic TCP/IP sockets must be identified by IP addresses and port numbers, these things are more commonly referred to by host and service names.</p><p>For example, the AltaVista web search engine is more easily identified and remembered by its name <span class="Italic">www.altavista.com</span> than by any one of its IP addresses.</p><p>Port numbers are also often referred to by service names which are more convenient to remember. Furthermore, port numbers, even the so-called <span class="Italic">well-known port numbers</span>, sometimes change, and your application will be more robust and flexible if you use names rather than hard-coded port numbers.</p><p>The WinSock API provides functions to resolve host names to IP addresses and service names to port numbers and these facilities are included in the Dyalog APL TCP/IP support.</p><p>Name resolution, in particular the resolution of host names, is performed <span class="Italic">asynchronously</span>. This means that an application requests that a name be resolved, and then receives a message some time later reporting the answer. The asynchronous nature of name resolution is reflected in the way it is handled by Dyalog APL. Note that in certain cases, the resolution of a host name may take several seconds.</p><p>Each of the properties LocalPort, RemotePort, LocalAddr and RemoteAddr has a corresponding <span class="Italic">name</span> property, i.e. LocalPortName, RemotePortName, LocalAddrName and RemoteAddrName. When you create a TCPSocket object, you may specify one or the other, but not both. For example, wherever you would use RemoteAddr, you may use RemoteAddrName instead.</p><p>If you use a<span class="Italic"> name </span>property, when you create a TCPSocket object, the TCPSocket will raise a TCPGotAddr or TCPGotPort event when the name is resolved to an IP address or a port number respectively. There is no need to take any action when these events are raised, so there is no specific need to attach callback functions. However, it may be useful to do so in order to track the progress of the requested connection.</p><p>The use of RemoteAddrName and TCPGotAddr is illustrated by the <tt>BROWSER.QUERY</tt> function that is described in the next Chapter.</p></body>
