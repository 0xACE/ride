<body><h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>OLE Automation allows you to drive one application from another and to mix code written in different programming languages.  In practical terms, this means that you may write a subroutine to perform calculations in (say) C++ and use the subroutine directly in Visual Basic 4 or Excel.  Equally, you could write the code in Visual Basic and call it from C++.  Dyalog APL/W is a fully subscribed member of this code-sharing club.</p><p>OLE Automation is, however, much more than just a mechanism to facilitate cross-application macros because it deals not just with subroutine calls but with <span class="Italic">objects</span>.  An object is a combination of code and data that can be treated as a unit.  Without getting too deeply into the terminology, an object defines a <span class="Italic">class</span>; when you work with an object you create one or more <span class="Italic">instances</span> of that class.</p><p>This chapter describes how Dyalog APL can drive other applications using OLE Automation. In these circumstances, Dyalog APL is acting as an OLE <span class="Italic">client</span>.</p><p>There are two types of OLE object involved; OLE Servers and ActiveX controls. An ActiveX control can be instantiated as a GUI object within a Dyalog APL Form, whereas an OLE Server either has no GUI component, or is a separate object. Otherwise, the two are very similar.</p><p>You can obtain lists of the OLE Servers and ActiveX Controls installed on your computer from the OLEServers and OLEControls properties of the system object <tt>'.'</tt>. These lists are obtained from your Windows Registry and therefore contains only those OLE objects that are correctly installed. Each OLE Server and OLE Control is identified by its name and class identifier. Either may be used to access it.</p></body>
