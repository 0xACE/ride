<body><h2><a name="Calculate_Buttons"></a>Adding Calculate Buttons</h2><p>Our Temperature Converter must work both ways; from Fahrenheit to Centigrade and vice versa. There are a number of different ways of making this happen.</p><p>A simple approach is to have two buttons for the user to press; one for Fahrenheit to Centigrade, and one for Centigrade to Fahrenheit. We will call the first one <tt>F2C</tt> and place it alongside the Fahrenheit edit field. The caption on this button will be <tt>'F-&gt;C'</tt>. When the user presses the button, we want our application to calculate the centigrade temperature. For this we need a <span class="Italic">callback function</span>. Let's call it <tt>f2c</tt>. Notice how you associate a callback function with a particular event. In this case, the Select event. This event is generated by a Button when it is pressed.</p><p>(The statement below is broken into two only so as to fit on the page)</p><pre>      FB←'Button' 'F-&gt;C' (10 70)('Event' 'Select' 'f2c')
      'TEMP.F2C'⎕WC FB</pre><p><img src="../images/temperature-converter-5.png" /></p><p>Notice that it is not necessary to specify the Size of the button; the default size fits the Caption nicely. Now let's add the Centigrade to Fahrenheit button. This will be called <tt>C2F</tt> and have an associated callback function <tt>c2f</tt>. We could have chosen to have a single callback function associated with both buttons, which would save a few lines of code. Having separate functions is perhaps clearer.</p><p>Again, the statement is split into two only to make it fit onto the page.</p><pre>      FC←'Button' 'C-&gt;F' (40 70)('Event' 'Select' 'c2f')
