We will call the Form <tt>'TEMP'</tt> and give it a title (Caption) of "Temperature Converter".</p><p>We will position the Form 68% down and 50% along the screen. This will avoid it interfering with the APL Session Window, and make development easier.</p><p>The Form will have a height equal to 30% of the height of the screen, and a width of 40% of the screen width.</p><pre>      TITLE←'Temperature Converter'
