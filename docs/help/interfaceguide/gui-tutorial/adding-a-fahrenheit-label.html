<body><h2><a name="Farenheit_Label"></a>Adding a Fahrenheit Label</h2><p>We are going to need two edit fields to input and display temperatures and two labels to identify them.</p><p>Let's create the "Fahrenheit" label first. It doesn't really matter what we call it because we won't need to refer to it later. Nevertheless, it has to have a name. Let's call it <tt>LF</tt>. We will place it at (10,10) but we don't need to specify its Size; <tt>⎕WC</tt> will make it just big enough to fit its Caption. </p><pre>      'TEMP.LF' ⎕WC'Label' 'Fahrenheit'(10 10)</pre><p><img src="../images/temperature-converter-2.png" /></p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
