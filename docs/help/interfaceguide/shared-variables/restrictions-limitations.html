<body><h2><a name="Restrictions_Limitations"></a>Restrictions &amp; Limitations</h2><p>Although shared variables have been implemented as closely to the APL standard as is possible, certain restrictions are imposed by the nature of DDE itself.</p><p>The server cannot make an offer to a specific client. Instead, it must broadcast a "general" offer, which could be accepted by any client. Indeed neither the client nor the server can specifically identify the other task.</p><p>Dyalog APL supports Excel "Fast Table Format" for communications with Excel (and with any other application that supports this format). This imposes the following restrictions :</p><ul><li value="1">The maximum number of numbers that you can send to Excel is 8191. Any attempt to send more will result in a LENGTH ERROR. This is because APL currently tries to send all the data in a single block. Larger amounts of data can be received from Excel, because Excel will send several blocks if required. The restriction may be lifted in due course.</li><li value="2">The maximum length of a character vector (which represents a string within a cell) is 255.</li></ul><p>A client APL program can only use indexed assignment to change the value of a shared variable if it already knows the up-to-date value of the variable, i.e. if its <tt>⎕SVS</tt> is 0 0 1 1 or 1 0 1 0. An attempt to use indexed assignment on a variable whose <tt>⎕SVS</tt> is 0 1 0 1 will cause a NONCE error.</p><p>Consider Excel as a server and APL as client with several warm links to an Excel spreadsheet e.g.:</p><pre>      'DDE:EXCEL|SHEET1' ⎕SVO 'X R1C1'
      'DDE:EXCEL|SHEET1' ⎕SVO 'Y R2C2'
      'DDE:EXCEL|SHEET1' ⎕SVO 'Z R3C3'</pre><p>If R1C1 is changed in Excel, APL expects to be told only of that change. Instead, Excel tells APL that ALL the linked cells have changed.</p><p>If APL pokes a value back to R1C1, Excel again tells APL that ALL the linked cells have changed.</p><p>You must take care to avoid this problem when dealing with DDE between Excel and APL.</p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
