<body><h2><a name="Calling_OLE_Asynch"></a>Calling an OLE Function Asynchronously</h2><h4><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h4><p>Functions exported by an OLEServer are executed (by the underlying OLE technology) in a <span class="Italic">synchronous</span> manner. This means that the OLE client must wait for the function to complete before it can continue processing.</p><p>In certain cases the client may not be interested in a result from a function and it may be desirable for client not to have to wait. For example, if a function updates files or performs a printing task, it would be nice for the client application to continue while the server performs this task in background, or indeed (using DCOM) on another computer.</p><p>For an <span class="Italic">out-of-process</span> OLE Server, this can be achieved by having the function that is called directly by the client <span class="Italic">post</span> an event (using <tt>⎕NQ</tt>) onto the event queue and then return. When the function terminates, APL will take the next event from the queue and take the appropriate action. If the event has an associated callback function, APL will invoke it. Note that this happens immediately <span class="Italic">after</span> the original function has terminated and a result (if any) has been returned to the client. This means that the APL OLEServer continues processing at the same time as the client application.</p><p>Note however that while the OLEServer is processing, further OLE requests will be queued. For example, if the client were to call the same function again immediately, the function would not be invoked until the original processing has finished and the client would therefore wait (note that OLE itself will actually time-out after a certain period). Nevertheless, this technique is an effective way to offload batch processing tasks to a second (background) APL process or to one running on a different computer.</p><h4><a name="OLEASYNC_Workspace"></a>The OLEASYNC Workspace</h4><p>The OLEASYNC workspace illustrates this technique. It contains a single namespace called <tt>Async</tt> which exports 2 functions (methods), <tt>PRINT</tt> and <tt>ASYNC</tt> and two variables (properties) <tt>ERRCODE</tt> and <tt>COPIES</tt>.</p><p>The first function, <tt>PRINT</tt>, prints a specified number of test pages <span class="Italic">in the background</span>. <tt>PRINT</tt> does not actually do any printing. All it does is to associate a second function <tt>PRINT_CB</tt> as a callback on a user-defined event 3001 (the choice of 3001 is purely arbitrary). It then posts an event 3001 onto the queue and returns 0 as its result.</p><p>The function also illustrates the use of <tt>:Trap</tt>. Should either of the statements on lines <tt>[3]</tt> and <tt>[4]</tt> fail, the function terminates cleanly and returns <tt>⎕DM</tt> instead.</p><pre>      ∇ R←PRINT N
