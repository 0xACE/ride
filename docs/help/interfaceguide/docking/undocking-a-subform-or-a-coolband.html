<body><h2><a name="Undocking_SubForm"></a>Undocking a SubForm or a CoolBand</h2><p>When a SubForm or a CoolBand is undocked, it becomes a Form.</p><p>The object may either become a Form that is a child of Root, or a Form that remains the child of the Form from where it was undocked. Such an object will always appear <span class="Italic">on top of</span> its parent, even when undocked.</p><p>This behaviour is controlled by the UndocksToRoot Property</p><p>Note that a Form or a CoolBand object may be undocked if its Dockable property is set to <tt>'Always'</tt>; the DockChildren property does not apply to the Root object.</p><p>The Root object does not provide DockMove events, but the docked object will generate a DockRequest event when the user releases the mouse button over the desktop. This may be used to disable or modify the operation.</p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
