<body><h2><a name="Browsing_Net_Classes"></a>Browsing .Net Classes</h2><p>Microsoft supplies a tool for browsing .NET Class libraries called <span class="Code">ILDASM.EXE</span><span class="MCTextPopup"><span class="MCTextPopupBody_0" style="display: none; ">  ILDASM.EXE can be found in the .NET SDK and is distributed with Visual Studio</span><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopupSpot_0" onclick="FMCTextPopup( event, this ); return false;" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super">1</a></span>.</p><p>As a convenience, the Dyalog APL Workspace Explorer has been extended to perform a similar task as <span class="Code">ILDASM</span> so that you can gain access to the information within the context of the APL environment.</p><p>The information that describes .NET classes, which is known as its <span class="Italic">Metadata</span>, is part of the definition of the class and is stored with it. This Metadata corresponds to Type Information in COM, which is typically stored in a separate Type Library.</p><p>To enable the display of Metadata in the Workspace Explorer, you must have the <span class="Italic">Type Libraries</span> option of the <span class="Italic">View</span> menu checked.</p><p>To gain information about one or more Net Classes, open the Workspace Explorer, right click the <span class="Italic">Metadata</span> folder, and choose <span class="Italic">Load</span>. </p><p><img src="../images/browsing-net-classes-1.png" /></p><p>This brings up the <span class="Name">Browse .Net Assembly</span> dialog box as shown below. Navigate to the .NET assembly of your choice, and click <span class="Name">Open</span>.</p><p><img src="../images/browsing-net-classes-2.png" /></p><p>Note that the .NET Classes provided with the .NET Framework are typically located in <span class="Code">C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\V2.0.50215</span>. The last named folder is the Version number.</p><p>The most commonly used classes of the .NET Namespace System are stored in this directory in an Assembly named <span class="Code">mscorlib.dll</span>, along with a number of other fundamental .NET Namespaces.</p><p>The result of opening this Assembly is illustrated in the following screen shot. The somewhat complex tree structure that is shown in the Workspace Explorer merely reflects the structure of the Metadata itself.</p><p><img src="../images/browsing-net-classes-3.png" /></p><p>Opening the <span class="Name">System/ Classes</span> sub-folder causes the Explorer to display the list of classes contained in the .NET Namespace<span class="Name"> System</span> as shown in the picture below.</p><p><img src="../images/browsing-net-classes-4.png" /></p><p>The <span class="Name">Constructors</span> folder shows you the list of all of the valid constructors and their parameter sets with which you may create a new instance of the Class by calling <tt>New</tt>. The constructors are those named <span class="Name">.ctor</span>; you may ignore the one named <span class="Name">.cctor</span>, (the class constructor) and any labelled as <span class="Italic">Private</span>.</p><p>For example, you can deduce that <tt>DateTime.New</tt> may be called with three numeric (<span class="Code">Int32</span>) parameters, or six numeric (<span class="Code">Int32</span>) parameters, and so forth. There are in fact seven different ways that you can create an instance of a <span class="Code">DateTime</span>.</p><p><img src="../images/browsing-net-classes-5.png" /></p><p>For example, the following statement may be used to create a new instance of <span class="Code">DateTime</span> (09:30 in the morning on 30<sup>th</sup> April 2001):</p><pre>      mydt←⎕NEW DateTime (2001 4 30 9 30 0)
 
      mydt
30/04/2001 09:30:00</pre><p>The <span class="Name">Properties</span> folder provides a list of the properties supported by the Class. It shows the name of the property followed by its data type. For example, the <span class="Code">DayOfYear</span> property is defined to be of type <span class="Code">Int32</span>.</p><p><img src="../images/browsing-net-classes-6.png" /></p><p>You can query a property by direct reference:</p><pre>      mydt.DayOfWeek
Monday</pre><p>Notice too that the data types of some properties are not simple data types, but Classes in their own right. For example, the data type of the <span class="Code">Now</span> property is itself <span class="Code">System.DateTime</span>. This means that when you reference the <span class="Code">Now</span> property, you get back an object that represents an instance of the <span class="Code">System.DateTime</span> object:</p><pre>      mydt.Now
07/11/2001 11:30:48
      ⎕TS
2001 11 7 11 30 48 0</pre><p>The <span class="Name">Methods</span> folder lists the methods supported by the Class. The Explorer shows the data type of the result of the method, followed by the name of the method and the types of its arguments. For example, the <span class="Code">IsLeapYear </span>method takes an <span class="Code">Int32</span> parameter (year) and returns a <span class="Code">Boolean</span> result.</p><pre>      mydt.IsLeapYear 2000
1</pre><p><img src="../images/browsing-net-classes-7.png" /></p><p>Many of the reported objects are listed as <span class="Italic">Private</span>, which means they are inaccessible to users of the class – you are not able to call them or inspect their value. For more information about classes, see the chapter on <span class="Name">Object Oriented Programming</span> in the <span class="Name">Dyalog APL Language Reference Manual</span>.</p><p><img src="../images/browsing-net-classes-8.png" /></p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
