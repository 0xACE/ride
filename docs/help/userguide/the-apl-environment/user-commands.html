<body><h2><a name="_Toc289335835"></a>User Commands</h2><p>Dyalog APL includes a mechanism to define <span class="Italic">User Commands</span>.</p><p>User commands are developer tools, written in APL, which can be executed without having to explicitly copy code into your workspace and/or save it in every workspace in which you want to use it.</p><p>A User Command is a name prefixed by a closing square bracket, which may be niladic or take an argument. A User Command executes APL code that is typically stored somewhere outside the current active workspace.</p><p>By default, the existing SPICE command processor is hooked up to the user command mechanism, and a number of new SPICE commands have been added. For example:</p><pre>      ]display 'hello' (⍪'world')
┌→────────────┐
│ ┌→────┐ ┌→┐ │
│ │hello│ ↓w│ │
│ └─────┘ │o│ │
│         │r│ │
│         │l│ │
│         │d│ │
│         │w│ │
│         └─┘ │
└∊────────────┘</pre><p>The implementation of User Commands is very simple: If a line of input begins with a closing square bracket (<tt>]</tt>), and there exists a function by the name <tt>⎕SE.UCMD</tt>, then the interpreter will call that function, passing the input line (without the bracket) as the right argument. </p><p>To add a user command, drop a new Spice command file in the folder SALT\Spice.</p></body>
