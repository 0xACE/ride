<body><h3><a name="Version_13.0_IME_Configuration"></a>Configuring the Dyalog APL IME
</h3><p>The following description uses screenshots taken from a Windows 7 PC with three Input Languages configured for the current user: English (United Kingdom) - the default Input Language, Danish (Denmark) and English (United States).</p><p>The Dyalog Unicode IME is added as an additional service to all keyboards defined to the user and the administrator at the time that the IME was installed.</p><p>For each IME the underlying keyboard layout file will be the same as that defined for the base keyboard. The layout file is a DLL created by Microsoft.</p><p>The language specified in the description of the IME is the name of the IME translate table that has been associated with the IME for the specific keyboard. In the case of languages not supported by the IME the keyboard will default to en-US. With the IME as supplied with Version 13.2 altering this text requires editing the appropriate Registry value.</p><p>The IME may be configured from within APL or from Windows.</p><h4>From within Dyalog APL</h4><p> To change the properties of the IME go to <span class="Italic"> Options/Configure/Unicode Input</span> tab and select
<span class="Italic"> Configure Layout</span>:
<br /><img src="../images/configuration-dialog-unicode-input-tab.png" /></p><h4>From Windows</h4><p>Right click on either the Input Language icon or the Keyboard layout icon in the TaskBar and select
<span class="Italic">Settings</span>:</p><p><img src="../images/v13imeconfig1.jpg" /></p><p><img src="../images/v13imeconfig2.jpg" /></p><p>To alter the configuration of any of the installed IMEs, select that IME and click on
<span class="Italic">Properties</span>:</p><p><img src="../images/ime-props.png" /></p><h4>Input translate table:</h4><p>The translate table defines the mapping between APL characters and the keystrokes that generate those APL characters. It is possible to alter the mapping or to create support for new keyboards by altering the translate table, or by selecting a different translate table. See the <span class="Name">IME User Guide</span> for more details.</p><h4>Overstrikes:</h4><p>In the original implementations of APL, many of the special symbols could only be generated by overstriking one character on top of another as is reflected in the appearance of the glyphs. For example, the symbol for Grade Up (<tt>⍋</tt>) is actually the symbol for delta (<tt>∆</tt>) superimposed on the symbol for vertical bar (<tt>|</tt>)</p><p>In Dyalog APL such symbols can be generated either by a single keystroke, or (in <span class="Italic">Replace</span> mode) by overtyping one symbol with another. For example <tt>⍋</tt> may be generated using Shift+Ctrl+4, or by switching to <span class="Italic">Replace</span> mode and typing the three keystrokes Ctrl+h, Left-Cursor, Ctrl+m.</p><p>Using the Dyalog Unicode IME the character can also be entered by pressing Ctrl+Bksp, Ctrl+m, Ctrl+h. Note that Ctrl+Bksp is the default <span class="Italic">Overstrike Introducer Key</span> (key code
OS).</p><h4>Use Overstrike popup:</h4><p>With this option selected, when the character following the Overstrike Introducer Key is pressed, a popup box displays all the overstrikes which contain the last character typed: in the example below Ctrl+Bksp has been followed by Ctrl+h:</p><p><img src="../images/overstrikepopup.jpg" /></p><p>Note the fine (red) line under the <tt>∆</tt> in the Session window. This indicates that an overstrike creation operation is in progress.</p><p>The input of the symbol <tt>⍋</tt> can be completed by pressing Ctr+m, or by moving the selection up and down the pop-up list using Cursor-Up or Cursor-Down </p><h4>Overstrikes do not require the OS introducer key (experimental):</h4><p>With this option selected, the IME identifies characters which are part of a valid overstrike, and when such a character is entered into the session, begins an overstrike creation operation. This mode is experimental in the IME supplied with Version 13.2.</p></body>
