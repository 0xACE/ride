<body><h2><a name="Debugging_Threads"></a>Debugging Threads</h2><p>The Debugger  provides a tabbed interface that allows you to easily switch between suspended threads for debugging purposes. To keep things simple for non-threaded applications, Tabs are only displayed if there is a thread suspended that is other than Thread 0. The following picture shows the Debugger open on a multi-threaded application (LIFT.DWS) when only Thread 0 is suspended. This has been achieved by setting a stop on <tt>RUN[63]</tt></p><p><img src="../images/debugging-threads-1.png" /></p><p>In the next picture, the user has chosen to display the <span class="Name">Threads Tool</span> and then dock it between the Session and Debugger windows. Note that only one thread, thread 0 (<tt>Run</tt>) is suspended. All the other threads are <span class="Name">Paused</span> (because <span class="Name">Pause on Error </span>is enabled).</p><p><img src="../images/debugging-threads-2.png" /></p><p>The user then uses the context menu to <span class="Name">Switch To</span> Thread 6 (whose name is <tt>Lady 6</tt>) which was Paused on <tt>PERSON[7]</tt> in the middle of a <tt>⎕TGET</tt>. The act of switching to this thread caused it to be suspended at the beginning of its current line <tt>PERSON[7] </tt>and the Debugger now displays two Tabs to represent the two suspended threads. Note that both the thread id and the thread name are displayed on the Tabs.</p><p><img src="../images/debugging-threads-3.png" /></p><p>Note also that the Session window is connected to the thread indicated by the selected Tab. In this case, typing <tt>MYFLOOR</tt> into the Session window displays the value of the local variable <tt>MYFLOOR</tt> in Thread 6 (<tt>Lady 6</tt>).</p><p>You can use the Tabs to switch between the suspended threads, so clicking the Tab labelled <tt>0:Run</tt> causes the display to change to the picture shown below. The Session is now connected to Thread 0 (<tt>Run</tt>), so the value of <tt>⎕LC</tt> is 63. </p><p><img src="../images/debugging-threads-4.png" /></p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
