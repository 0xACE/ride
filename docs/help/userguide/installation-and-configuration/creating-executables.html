<body><h2><a name="Creating_Executables"></a>Creating Executables</h2><p>Dyalog APL provides the facility to package an APL workspace as a Windows executable (EXE). This may be done by selecting <span class="Name">Export …</span> from the <span class="Name">File</span> menu of the APL Session window.</p><p>The system provides the following options:</p><ul><li value="1">You may bind your EXE as a Dyalog APL run-time application, or as a Dyalog APL developer application. The second option will allow you to debug the application should it encounter an APL error.</li><li value="2"> You may bind your EXE as a console-mode application. A console application does not have a graphical user interface, but runs as a background task using files or TCP/IP to perform input and output.</li><li value="3">You may specify whether or not your .EXE will honour <span class="Italic">Native Look and Feel</span> if this is enabled at the Windows level.</li></ul><p>You can package the workspace as a stand-alone executable or as a .EXE file that must be accompanied by the Dyalog APL Dynamic Link Library (<span class="Code">dyalog132.dll</span> or <span class="Code">dyalog132rt.dll</span>), in which case the DLL should be installed in the same directory (as the EXE) or in the Windows System directory.</p><p>The following example illustrates how you can package the supplied workspace <span class="Code">calc.dws</span> as an executable. Before making the executable, it is essential to set up the latent expression to run the program using <tt>⎕LX</tt> as shown. Notice that in this case it is not necessary to execute <tt>⎕OFF</tt>; the <span class="Code">calc.exe</span> program will terminate normally when the user closes the calculator window and the system returns to Session input.</p><p><img src="../images/creating-executables-1.png" /></p><p>Then, when you select <span class="Name">Export…</span> from the <span class="Name">File</span> menu, the following dialog box is displayed.</p><p><img src="../images/creating-executables-2.png" /></p><p>In the example shown, the program is to be saved in ws, the (supplied workspaces) directory from which the workspace was loaded (the default).</p><p>The <span class="Name">Save as Type</span> option has been set to <span class="Name">Standalone Executable (includes interpreter exe)</span> which means that a single .EXE will be created containing the Dyalog APL executable and the CALC workspace. </p><p>The <span class="Name">Runtime application</span> checkbox is checked, indicating that <span class="Code">calc.exe</span> is to incorporate the runtime version of Dyalog APL.. </p><p>As this is a GUI application, the <span class="Name">Console application</span> checkbox is left unset.</p><p>The <span class="Name">Enable Native Look and Feel</span> checkbox has been set so that <span class="Code">calc.exe</span> will honour <span class="Italic">Native Look and Feel</span> if it is enabled at the Windows level.</p><p>Note that if you enter the name of a file containing an icon (use the <span class="Name">Browse</span> button to browse for it) that icon will be bound with your executable and be used instead of the standard Dyalog APL icon.</p><p>The <span class="Name">Command Line</span> box allows you to enter parameters and values that are to be passed to your executable when it is invoked.</p><p>On clicking <span class="Name">Save</span>, the following message box is displayed to confirm success.</p><p><img src="../images/creating-executables-3.png" /></p><h4><a name="_Toc289335646"></a>Version Information</h4><p>You may embed version information into your .exe by clicking the <span class="Name">Version</span> button and then completing the <span class="Name">Version Information</span>n dialog box that is illustrated below.</p><p><img src="../images/creating-executables-4.png" /></p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
