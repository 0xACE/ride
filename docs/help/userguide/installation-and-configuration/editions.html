        </h2><p>Dyalog APL continues to be available in two separate editions; <span class="Italic">Unicode </span>and <span class="Italic">Classic</span>.</p><ul><li value="1">The <span class="Italic">Unicode</span> edition is intended for users who need to develop
    Unicode applications now, and are prepared to make the necessary (usually
    small) changes to existing applications in order to support new Unicode
    character types.</li><li value="2">The <span class="Italic">Classic</span> edition is intended for customers who want to take
    advantage of other product enhancements, but do not wish to use Unicode at
    this time.</li></ul><p>The two different editions are maintained from the same source code, and
every effort will be made to ensure that they are identical except for the
handling of character arrays, and the transfer of data into and out of the
workspace.</p></body>
