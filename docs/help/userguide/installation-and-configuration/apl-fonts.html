<body><h2><a name="_Toc289335530"></a>APL Fonts</h2><h4><a name="Unicode"></a>Unicode Edition</h4><p>The default font for the Unicode Edition is APL385 Unicode<span class="MCTextPopup"><span class="MCTextPopupBody_0" style="display: none; "> The Dyalog Std TT, Dyalog Alt TT, and APL385 Unicode fonts are the copyright of Adrian Smith. </span><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopupSpot_0" onclick="FMCTextPopup( event, this ); return false;" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super">1</a></span> which is a TrueType font and is installed as part of Dyalog APL. APL385 Unicode is the font used to print APL characters in this manual. In principle, you may use any other Unicode font that includes the APL symbols, such as Arial Unicode MS (available from Microsoft).</p><h4><a name="Classic"></a>Classic Edition</h4><p>In the Classic Edition, there are two types of APL font provided; bitmap (screen) and TrueType. There are also two different layouts, which are referred to as <span class="Italic">Std</span> and <span class="Italic">Alt</span>.</p><p>The bitmap fonts are designed for the screen alone and are named <span class="Italic">Dyalog Std</span> and <span class="Italic">Dyalog Alt</span>. The TrueType fonts have a traditional 2741-style italic appearance and are named <span class="Italic">Dyalog Std TT</span> and <span class="Italic">Dyalog Alt TT</span><sup>1</sup>.</p><p>The <span class="Italic">Std</span> layout, which was the standard layout for Versions of Dyalog APL up to Version 10.1 contains the APL underscored alphabet <tt>Ⓐ-Ⓩ</tt>. <b>The underscored alphabet is a deprecated feature and is only supported in this Version of Dyalog APL for backwards compatibility.</b></p><p>The <span class="Italic">Alt</span> layout, which replaced the <span class="Italic">Std</span> layout as the standard layout for Version 12.0 Classic Edition onwards, does not have the underscored alphabet, but contains additional National Language characters in their place. Note that the extra National Language symbols share the same <tt>⎕AV</tt> positions with the underscored alphabet. If, for example, you switch from the <span class="Italic">Std</span> font layout to the alternative one, you will see the symbol <tt>Á</tt> (A-acute) instead of the symbol <span class="Dyalog" style="text-decoration: underline;">Ⓐ</span> (A-underscore). </p><p>You may use either a bitmap font or a TrueType font in your APL session (see <span class="XRef">User's Guide: </span><span class="XRef">Session Operations</span><a href="../the-apl-environment/session-toolbars.html#Session_Operations" class="MCXref_0">Session Operations</a> for details). You MUST use a TrueType font for printing APL functions.</p></body>
