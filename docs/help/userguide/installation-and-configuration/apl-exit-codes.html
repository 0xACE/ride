<body><h2><a name="APL_Exit_Codes"></a>APL Exit Codes</h2><p>When APL or a bound .EXE terminates, it returns an exit code to the calling environment. If APL is started from a desktop icon, the return code is ignored. However, if APL is started from a script (UNIX) or a command processor, the exit code is available and may be used to determine whether or not to continue with other processing tasks. The return codes are:</p><table><tr><td>0</td><td>successful <tt>⎕OFF</tt>, <tt>)OFF</tt>, <tt>)CONTINUE</tt>, graphical exit from GUI</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>APL failed to start. This will occur if there was a failure to read a translate file, there is insufficient memory, or a critical parameter is incorrectly specified or missing.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>APL was terminated by SIGHUP or SIGTERM (UNIX) or in response to a QUIT WINDOWS request. APL has done a clean exit.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>APL issued a syserror.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Runtime violation. This occurs if a runtime application attempts to read input from the Session. Only a development version has a Session.</td></tr></table><p>Notes:</p><p>Under UNIX exit codes greater than 127 indicates (127+signal number) of the untrapped signal which caused the process to terminate.</p><p>APL applications can generate  a custom return code by specifying an integer value to the right of<tt> ⎕OFF</tt>. Dyalog recommends using values greater than 10 for this purpose.</p></body>
