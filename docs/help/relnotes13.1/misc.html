<body><h3><a name="Miscellaneous"></a>Miscellaneous</h3><h4>Component Checksum Validation</h4><p>There is a new function <tt>3002⌶</tt> which controls whether or not components read by <tt>⎕FREAD</tt> are subject to checksum validation.</p><p>For further information, see.<a href="../lang/primops/component-checksum-validation.html#Disable_Component_Checksum_Validation">Component Checksum Validation</a>.</p><h4>Core to APLCore</h4><p>There is a new function <tt>685⌶</tt> that extracts an <span class="Code">aplcore</span> file from a UNIX <span class="Code">core</span> file. </p><p>For further information see <a href="../lang/primops/core-to-aplcore.html#CoreToAPLCore">Core to APLCore</a>.</p><h4>Windows: Associating workspaces etc. with specific Version</h4><p>Under Windows, when Dyalog APL is installed, all Dyalog-specific files are associated with that version. A new User Command, <tt>]EFA</tt>, has been included which allows the user to select which of the versions of Dyalog APL installed on the PC should be associated with Dyalog files. See the <span class="Name">SALT-UCMD release notes</span> for more details.</p><h4>GetAvailableWorkspace</h4><p>This undocumented method of Root has been removed. It is superceded by <tt>2000⌶</tt>.</p><p>For further information see <a href="../lang/primops/memory-manager-statistics.html#MemoryManagerStatistics">Memory Management Statistics</a>.</p><h4>Change to :Hold</h4><p>If APL detects a deadlock situation, it now executes the <tt>:Else</tt> clause in preference to generating an error.</p><p>For further information, see <a href="../lang/control-structures/hold.html#HoldStatement">Hold Statement</a>.</p><h4>COM Interface Changes</h4><p>In Version 13.0 and earlier the Dyalog APL  COM (OLE) interface converted incoming values of type VT_CY (a 64 bit value, sometimes referred to as VT_CURRENCY)  to a two element vector containing the high 32 bits of the value and the low 32 bits of the value.</p><p>As Version 13.1 supports the DECF element type the OLE interface now converts incoming VT_CY values to DECFs, which means the value can be stored as a single scalar numeric value.</p><p>In Version 13.0 and earlier, VT_DECIMAL types were converted to 8 byte floating point values, which could have resulted in a loss of precision. Version 13.1 converts VT_DECIMALS to DECFs, which will  not result in a loss of precision.</p><p>Note that <tt>⎕FR</tt> should be set appropriately if arithmetic is to be performed on the resultant arrays.</p><h4>Component Numbers</h4><p>Previously, the component number passed as an argument to a component file function was not properly validated, and was simply rounded downto an integer. In Version 13.1 the component number must be an integer, or the function will report <tt>DOMAIN ERROR</tt>.</p><h4>Enlist and Selective Assignment</h4><p>Enlist (<tt>∊</tt> with <tt>⎕ML&gt;0</tt>) may be used in selective assignment expressions.</p><p>Example:</p><pre>
      ⎕ml←1
      names←'Andy' 'Karen' 'Liam'
      (('a'=∊names)/∊names)←'*'
      names
 Andy  K*ren  Li*m</pre><h4>URL Strings</h4><p>In Windows versions valid URLs are identified when in the session or in the editor/tracer. When the mouse pointer is over a URL, the URL is underscored and the following items appear in the context menu:</p><ul><li value="1"><span class="Name">Open link</span>: this causes the URL to be opened in the default application appropriate for the URL. Ctrl+Left Mouse performs the same operation</li><li value="2"><span class="Name">Copy link to clipboard</span>: this causes the URL to be copied to the clipboard</li></ul><p>This feature can be enabled or disabled by selecting or unselecting the <span class="Name">Underline URLs and links</span> checkbox on the General tab in the Configure box. This is saved as the registry entry <span class="Parameter">URLHighlight</span>.</p><h4>Issue 8146: <span class="DyalogDefault">(⍬⌷mat)←0</span> should not change the shape of mat</h4><p>In Version 13.0 </p><pre>
      mat←2 3⍴⍳6
      (⍬⌷mat)←0
</pre><p>resulted in </p><pre>      mat
0
      ⍴mat


</pre><p>This is incorrect. In Version 13.1 this had been corrected so that</p><pre>      mat
0 0 0
0 0 0
</pre><h4>Dyalog Script Compiler</h4><p>The default value of <tt>⎕WX</tt> for the script compiler is now 3. If you require a different value for <tt>⎕WX</tt> you can specify it on the command line using the  <span class="Code">/wx</span> option, or assign it in your script. See the DotNet Interface Guide.</p><h4>Change to path with <span class="DyalogDefault">⎕USING</span> and :Using</h4><p>In previous versions if a .Net Assembly was referred to without a path, it would only be loaded if it was located in the .Net installation directory. With 13.1 Dyalog APL will first look in the directory in which the Dyalog program (or host application) is located, and then the .Net installation directory.</p><h4>Support for changing between .Net versions</h4><p>Dyalog APL has improved support for changing between .Net versions; see the <span class="Name">.Net Framework Tab</span> in the User Guide for more information.</p><h4>Clipboard Format support</h4><p>Dyalog APL now includes support (currently inbound only) for XMLSpreadSheet format.</p><h4>2-digit years and yy_window</h4><p>Dyalog APL now adheres to the 2-digit year rules which appear in the Windows Region and Language settings. These can be overridden using the <span class="Name">yy_window</span> parameter.</p><h4>Enhancement to <span class="DyalogDefault">⎕MONITOR</span></h4><p><tt>⎕MONITOR</tt> has been enhanced so that it now correctly allocates time to diamondised lines where the line start with <tt>:Case</tt> and similar constructs. </p></body>
