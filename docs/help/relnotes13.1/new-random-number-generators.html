<body><h3><a name="Random_Number_Generator"></a>New Random Number Generators </h3><p>The Version 13.0 random number generator, that is used by <a href="../lang/primfns/roll.html#Roll">Roll</a> and <a href="../lang/primfns/deal.html#Deal">Deal</a>, is based upon the Lehmer linear congruential generator. This has several limitations, most notably that it has a limited value range of <tt>(2*31)</tt>. Mindful of the need to support applications that rely on the current mechanism, and the ability to generate specific repeatable random series using <tt>⎕RL</tt>, Dyalog has decided to provide two additional random number generators in Version 13.1. Both the new algorithms support 64-bit values and both  may be considered to be an improvement (in terms of randomness) over the current mechanism. The new mechanisms are:</p><ul><li value="1">Mersenne Twister random number generator. This algorithm produces 64-bit values with good distribution.</li><li value="2">Operating System random number generator. Under Windows APL this uses the <span class="Code">CryptGenRandom()</span> function. Under UNIX/Linux it uses <span class="Code">/dev/urandom[3]</span>.</li></ul><p>You may select  the random number generator in use using <tt>16807⌶</tt>. This allows you to switch dynamically between the different algorithms if required.</p><p>For further information, see <a href="../lang/primops/random-number-generator.html#Random_Number_Generator">Random Number Generator</a>.
