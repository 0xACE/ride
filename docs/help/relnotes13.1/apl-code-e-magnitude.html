<body><h3><a name="APL_CODE_E_MAGNITUDE"></a><span class="Parameter">APL_CODE_E_MAGNITUDE</span> Parameter</h3><p>Version 13.0 introduced decimal floating point numbers which have greater precision than IEEE floating point numbers. This increased the maximum allowable print precision  from 17 to 34 and this  had the side effect of changing the way numbers in function bodies are descanned<span class="MCTextPopup"><span class="MCTextPopupBody_0" style="display: none; ">Descanning refers to the internal process used to convert the internal representation of APL code into a character array. For numbers in function statements, this process  uses the maximum  value of Print Precision.</span><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopupSpot_0" onclick="FMCTextPopup( event, this ); return false;" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super">1</a></span>. For example, the number one sextillion (10<sup>21</sup>) in a function is descanned by Version 12.1 as <tt>1E21</tt> and by Version 13.0 as <tt>1000000000000000000000</tt>. </p><p>Note that only numbers <tt>X</tt> in the range <tt>(10*17) ≤ X  &lt;(10*34)</tt> are affected.</p><p>Whilst this change has no other deleterious effect, it means that code that contains such numbers is  harder to read, and the result of <tt>⎕CR</tt> (and other character representations) of the same function may have changed between Version 12.1 and Version 13.0 causing undesired affects in code management systems. </p><p>The <span class="Parameter">APL_CODE_E_MAGNITUDE</span> parameter allows the user to choose between current (Version 13.0 and onwards) and earlier behaviour. </p><p>If the <span class="Parameter">APL_CODE_E_MAGNITUDE</span> parameter is undefined or set to 0 (the default), numbers are descanned and displayed as normal.</p><p>If <span class="Parameter">APL_CODE_E_MAGNITUDE</span> is <tt>¯1</tt>, numbers greater than or equal to 10<sup>17</sup> will be displayed using exponential format, as in  Version 12.1.</p><p>The effect of setting this parameter to any other value is undefined.</p><script src="../../help.js"></script></body>
