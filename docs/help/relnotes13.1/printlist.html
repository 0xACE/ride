<body><h3><a name="PrintList"></a>Change to PrintList</h3><p>The mechanism used to generate the contents of the PrintList property has been updated to better support network printers and the current versions of Windows. The new mechanism uses a different set of Windows API calls. This means that in Version 13.1, the list is likely to include printers which were not included in previous versions and the names of the printers reported may be slightly different.</p><p>For further information, see <a href="../gui/props/printlist.html">PrintList</a>.</p><script src="../../help.js"></script></body>
