<body><h3><a name="Performance"></a>Performance Improvements</h3><h4><a name="Empty_Lines"></a>Empty-Line Processing</h4><p>The interpreter now requires less time to process empty lines in functions, i.e. those that contain only comments or have no content at all. Functions documented with a block of leading comment lines, in particular, will benefit from this optimisation.</p><p>This improvement is also implemented in Version 13.0 from 3<sup>rd</sup> January 2012 onwards.</p><h4><a name="Index_Of"></a>Dyadic Iota</h4><p>The code for dyadic iota (Index Of) has been optimised, giving a small performance improvement in most cases. This improvement is independent of the use of retained hash tables, which delivers additional performance benefits as before.</p><p>This improvement is also implemented in Version 13.0 from 3<sup>rd</sup> January 2012 onwards.</p><p>For further information see <a href="../lang/defined-functions-and-operators/search-functions-and-hash.html#SearchFunctionsAndHashTables">Search Functions and Hash Tables</a>.</p><h4><a name="New_Idioms"></a>New Idioms</h4><p>Two new idioms have been added. These are:</p><table><tr><td><tt>0=⊃⍴</tt></td><td>Is first dimension empty <tt>(⎕ML&lt;2)</tt></td></tr><tr><td><tt>0≠⊃⍴</tt></td><td>Is first dimension not empty <tt>(⎕ML&lt;2)</tt></td></tr></table><p>Note that these idioms were also added to Version 13.0 from 22<sup>nd</sup> December 2011 onwards.</p><h4><a name="Take"></a>Take</h4><p>The performance of an expression such as <tt>(N↑1)</tt> has been improved significantly in Version 13.1 compared to previous versions.</p></body>
