<body><h3><a name="Default_File_Properties"></a>New Defaults for File Properties</h3><p>When you create a new component file, the default levels of checksum and journaling are now both 1. These defaults may be changed using the<span class="Parameter"> APL_FCREATE_PROPS_J </span>and <span class="Parameter">APL_FCREATE_PROPS_C</span> parameters (see User Guide).</p><p>The new default will cause the creation of component files which are significantly more robust in the face of network and other system failures, and often more repairable using <tt>⎕FCHK</tt>. However, depending upon the way in which the application uses component files, there may be a noticeable reduction in system performance. Dyalog recommends the use of the new settings, however it is possible to configure the system to use a different default if necessary.</p><p>For further information, see <a href="../lang/sysfns/fprops.html"><tt>⎕FPROPS</tt></a></p><h3><a name="Large_Components"></a>Support for Larger Components</h3><p>In Version 13.1, the maximum size of a component on a component file is  2<sup>64</sup> bytes. Previously it was  2<sup>32</sup> bytes.</p><p><b>Note:</b> All builds of Version 12.0, 12.1 and 13.0 created after 24<sup>th</sup> November 2010 will refuse to read components greater than   2<sup>32</sup> bytes in size. Builds prior to this date will not handle large components correctly.</p><script src="../../help.js"></script></body>
