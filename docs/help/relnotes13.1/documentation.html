<body><h2>New Documentation</h2><p>Previously, Dyalog maintained all product documentation in various different formats, including Microsoft Word and HTML, depending upon the target publication media. The duplication of source material lead to inconsistencies in the different forms of publication.</p><p>Dyalog has now invested in a single-source solution for the documentation and has converted the bulk of the existing documentation to the new platform from which the Version 13.1 documentation has been produced.</p><p>The new platform will enable Dyalog to improve the quality of the documentation and the range of formats in which it can be published. It will also allow the documentation to be more easily maintained and to be updated in a more timely fashion. </p><p>Due to the nature of the conversion process, there are currently a number of typographical errors, particularly formatting errors, which Dyalog is still working to correct. For this reason, the Version 13.1 manuals may not yet be ordered in <span class="Italic">perfect bound</span> printed form from Lulu.</p></body>
