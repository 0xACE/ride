            </h2><p>Dyalog APL Version 13.2 provides the following miscellaneous enhancements and changes:</p><h4><tt>⎕FLIB</tt> Limitation Removed</h4><p>Component files that are exclusively tied were not previously reported by <tt>⎕FLIB</tt>. In Version 13.2 they are included in the result.</p><h4>APL_FHIST_TIE</h4><p>From Version 13.2 onwards, support for the <span class="Parameter">APL_FHIST_TIE</span> parameter has been removed. Component file tie time is not recorded and <tt>⎕FHIST</tt> always reports 0 for user ID and time in the 4th row of its result.</p><h4 class="Dyalog">⎕PROFILE</h4><p><tt>⎕PROFILE'data'</tt> and <tt>⎕PROFILE'tree'</tt> have been enhanced to take an optional left argument specifying which columns of data to return.</p><h4>Workspace Save</h4><p><tt>0 ⎕SAVE wsid</tt> no longer fails with <tt>DOMAIN ERROR</tt> if there are threads running or Edit/Trace windows open. These restrictions continue to apply to monadic <tt>⎕SAVE</tt> and <tt>)SAVE</tt>.</p><p><tt>)SAVE</tt> and <tt>⎕SAVE</tt> now insist that you explicitly specify a filename. Previously if you specified just the name of a directory, the  workspace was saved with the name <code>.DWS</code>.</p><h4>Keyboard Shortcuts</h4><p>Windows allows users to control the visibility of keyboard shortcuts.</p><p>Under Windows XP this is done from the <span class="Name">Display Properties</span> dialog box. Select the <span class="Name">Appearance</span> tab, then click the <span class="Name">Effects</span> button. Then select or clear the option labelled <span class="Name">Hide underlined letters for keyboard navigation until I press the Alt key</span>.</p><p>In Windows 7, open <span class="Name">Control Panel / Ease of Access Center / Make the Keyboard easier to use</span>.The option is labelled <span class="Name">Underline keyboard shortcuts and access keys</span></p><p>The Dyalog APL GUI now honours this option. This means that the underscores in the captions of certain objects, including Label,  MenuItem and Button objects, may or may not be shown until the user presses the Alt key.</p><p class="Bold">Note that the actual behaviour obtained by the option is controlled by Windows and not by Dyalog.</p><h4>SessionOnTop Parameter</h4><p>In <span class="Name">Classic Dyalog</span> mode, it is now possible to specify whether or not the Session window may appear on top of Edit and Trace windows. To enable this setting, check the option box as shown in the picture below.</p><p><img src="../userguide/images/configuration-dialog-sessionontop.png" /></p><h4>Find Objects Tool</h4><p>The Find Objects dialog box now saves all your option settings between invocations <span class="Italic">and</span> between APL sessions.</p><h4>MakeGIF and MakePNG Methods</h4><p>In Version 13.2, these methods are implemented using GDI+. This means that <tt>MakeGIF</tt> now generates <span class="Italic">compressed</span> GIF files. In previous versions it generated <span class="Italic">uncompressed</span> GIFs.</p><h4>Find/Replace Tool</h4><p>In previous versions of Dyalog APL the Find/Replace window was dockable. However, the resulting Window was in general unusable, with many of the fields and buttons not visible. In Version 13.2 the Find/Replace window is no longer dockable.</p></body>
