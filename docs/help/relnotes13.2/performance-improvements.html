<body><h2><a name="Performance_Improvements"></a>Performance Improvements</h2><h4>Reduction Operator</h4><p>The performance of certain reductions on non-vector numeric arrays has been improved. <tt>+/</tt>,<tt> ×/</tt>, <tt>⌈/</tt>, and <tt>⌊/</tt> on floating point numbers are faster by a factor of 6 while <tt>+⌿</tt>, <tt>×⌿</tt>, <tt>⌈⌿</tt>, and <tt>⌊⌿</tt> are faster by a factor of 2.  In addition, <tt>⌈/</tt> and <tt>⌊/</tt> are faster by the same factors on other numeric types, and likewise <tt>⌈⌿</tt> and <tt>⌊⌿</tt>.</p><h4>Scan Operator</h4><p>The time taken for <tt>≤\</tt>, <tt>&gt;\</tt>, <tt>≥\</tt>, <tt>⍱\</tt>, and <tt>⍲\</tt> has reduced from order n<sup>2</sup> to order n, where n is the length of the argument.</p><h4>Miscellaneous</h4><p>The performance of the following expressions, which mostly involve operations on Boolean arrays, has been improved. The degree of performance improvement is indicated in the column labelled <span class="Name">Factor</span>.</p><p>The meaning of the symbols used in the expressions is as follows:</p><table style="width: 11.6cm;"><tr><td>n</td><td>integer scalar</td></tr><tr><td>i</td><td>integer array</td></tr><tr><td>b</td><td>Boolean array</td></tr><tr><td>x</td><td>array</td></tr></table><table><tr><th class="Left">Expression</th><th class="Left">Factor</th><th class="Left">Comments</th></tr><tr><td><tt>n|i</tt></td><td>19-34</td><td>When <tt>n</tt> is  a power of 2.</td></tr><tr><td><tt>2⊥b</tt></td><td>17-21</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><tt>⌽b and ⊖b</tt></td><td>2-93</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><tt>(n⍴2)⊤i</tt></td><td>19-21</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><tt>x[b;...;]</tt></td><td>2-17</td><td><tt> </tt></td></tr><tr><td><tt>⍳n</tt></td><td>1-2</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><tt>⌽x</tt></td><td>4-230</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><tt>?i⍴2</tt></td><td>2-30</td><td>when <tt>⎕IO←0</tt></td></tr><tr><td><tt>b/⍳⍴b and b/⍳n</tt></td><td>3.5</td><td> </td></tr></table><h4>Search and Replace</h4><p><tt>⎕R</tt> and <tt>⎕S</tt>  operate significantly faster than before for simple searches – essentially, those without regular expressions, function transformations, options other than <span class="Name">Mode</span> or nested input documents.</p><h4>Pick in Selective Assignment</h4><p>The performance Pick (<tt>⊃</tt>) in selective assignment expressions is substantially faster than before.</p><h4>Stranding of Arrays</h4><p>The performance of the stranding of named arrays, as in expressions such as:</p><pre>       A B C D E F</pre><p>has been improved. The time taken has been reduced from being an order of n<sup>2</sup> to an order of n, where n is the number of names in the strand.</p><h4>Account Name</h4><p>The value of <tt>⎕AN</tt> is now cached in the workspace rather than being obtained dynamically every time it is referenced. Since <tt>⎕AN</tt> is used internally whenever a function is fixed applications which fix a very large number of functions will benefit from this caching.</p><script src="../../help.js"></script></body>
