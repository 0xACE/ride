<body><h2><a name="Announcements"></a>Announcements</h2><h4><a name="Support_12.1"></a>Support for Version 12.1 and 13.0</h4><p>Version 12.1 and Version 13.0 will continue to be supported until Version 14.0 is released, at which point both these Versions will cease to be supported.</p><h4><a name="Deprecated_Small_Span_Component_Files"></a>Deprecation of 32-bit component files</h4><p>Since Version 10.1, Dyalog APL has supported large span (64-bit) component files, and since Version 12.0 <tt>⎕FCREATE</tt> has created these by default. Existing small span (32-bit) component files are still supported and 32-bit component files may still be created if suitable options are specified, but they have restrictions which 64-bit files do not, including:</p><ul><li value="1">The maximum file size is 4GB.</li><li value="2">The files are not fully architecture-independent meaning that there are limitations sharing them between, for example, Windows or Linux and AIX machines.</li><li value="3">Components may not contain Unicode data.</li></ul><p class="Bold">As announced on the Release of Version 13.0, Dyalog intends to withdraw support for 32-bit component files in the next Release which will be Version 14.0.</p><p>If you have any existing 32-bit component files, or applications which create and/or use them, Dyalog recommends that you prepare for this in the following ways:</p><ul><li value="1">Ensure that Dyalog is not started with the command-line option -F32. This option sets the default component file type which is created to 32-bit.</li><li value="2">Ensure that no <tt>⎕FCREATE</tt> within your applications explicitly specifies that 32-bit files are to be created.</li><li value="3">Make plans to convert any existing 32-bit component files to 64-bit using <tt><a href="../lang/sysfns/fcopy.html">⎕FCOPY</a></tt>. <tt><a href="../lang/sysfns/fcopy.html">⎕FCOPY</a></tt>will create a 64-bit copy even if the file being copied is 32-bit. You may use the new user command <tt>]Fto64</tt> to locate existing small span files and convert them to the 64-bit architecture. Ths user command is included with Version 13.2, and can be downloaded for earlier versions as well (users of Version 13.1 can use the<tt>]UUPDATE</tt> command to download updated user commands).</li></ul><p>Note: in order to allow the use of legacy files retrieved from backups etc., Dyalog will continue to provide read-only support for 32-bit files in Version 14.0, and in subsequent releases for a minimum of 10 years.
</p><h4><a name="Deprecated_Auxiliary_Processors"></a>Auxiliary Processors</h4><p>It is intended that in the next major release, Version 14.0, all Dyalog-supplied Auxiliary Processors, namely <span class="Code">qfsck</span>, <span class="Code">strand</span> and <span class="Code">xutils</span> will be removed from the product, although the interfaces for user-written Auxiliary Processors will continue to be supported. Instead Dyalog will supply equivalent DLLs/shared libararies (operating system dependent).</p><h4><a name="Random_Number_Generator">Random Number Generator</a></h4><p>The Version 13.0 random number generator, that is used by Roll and Deal, is based upon the Lehmer linear congruential generator. This has several limitations, most notably that it has a limited value range of (2*31). Mindful of the need to support applications that rely on the current mechanism, and the ability to generate specific repeatable random series using <tt>⎕RL</tt>, Dyalog provided two additional random number generators in Version 13.1. Both the new algorithms support 64-bit values and both may be considered to be an improvement (in terms of randomness) over the existing mechanism. The new mechanisms were:</p><ul><li value="1">Mersenne Twister random number generator. This algorithm produces 64-bit values with good distribution.</li><li value="2">Operating System random number generator. Under Windows APL this uses the CryptGenRandom() function. Under UNIX/Linux it uses /dev/urandom[3].</li></ul><p>You may select the random number generator in use using <tt>16807⌶</tt>. This allows you to switch dynamically between the different algorithms if required.</p><p>In Versions 13.1 and 13.2 the default random number generator in a <tt>CLEAR WS</tt> is 0 (Lehmer linear congruential). <b>The default will be changed to 1 (Mersenne Twister) in the next release of Dyalog APL (Version 14.0). </b>In preparation for this change, avoid writing code which assumes that <tt>⎕RL</tt> will be a scalar integer.</p><p>Note: the change to the default will only impact applications if they are rebuilt from a clear workspace; saved workspaces will be unaffected.</p></body>
