<body><h2><a name="Icon_Bitmap_Enhancements"></a>Enhancements for Icon and Bitmap Objects</h2><p>Bitmap and Icon objects can now be created from files of type GIF, JPG and PNG in addition to the file types previously supported (BMP and ICO respectively). However, they may only be written (using the FileWrite method) to BMP and ICO files as before.</p><p>The size of the image displayed by an Icon object was previously determined by its Style property which was either <tt>'Small'</tt> (16x16) or <tt>'Large'</tt> (32x32). The image size is now overridden by the value of the Size property which may contain any appropriate value. Note that a ICO file can contain images of multiple sizes.</p><p>The Icon object now supports 32-bit icons (24-bit images with an 8-bit alpha channel) using the CBits property instead of the Bits, CMap and Mask properties. The Bitmap object also supports the same type of transparent images.</p><p>The Masked property of the ImageList object has been extended to support high-colour transparent images.</p><p>Â </p></body>
