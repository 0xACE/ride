<body><h2 class="Newpage">Introduction</h2><p>This manual is designed to assist users of the non-GUI versions of Dyalog APL on UNIX platforms. Although updated for Version <span class="TitlePageVersion">14.0</span> it applies applies to Versions 12.1 onwards.</p><p>Two versions of the interpreter are shipped with each Dyalog APL release: the development version and the server version.</p><p>The server version has the same functionality as the development version, other than that any attempt to read from the session, or use <tt>⎕SM</tt> or use <tt>⎕ARBIN</tt> will result in an <tt>EOF INTERRUPT</tt>. It is mainly intended for using Dyalog APL as a server process, where all I/O is processed using TCPSockets, or possibly via an auxiliary processor written by the user. Dyalog recommends using Conga in preference to native TCPSockets.</p><p>There are different licences associated with the development and server versions, which affects how each might be distributed.  For more information, please contact sales@dyalog.com.</p><p>All examples are written assuming that the Korn shell is being used.</p><p>This manual is intended for users of Dyalog APL on UNIX. The <span class="Name">Dyalog APL for UNIX User Guide</span> and the <span class="Name">Dyalog APL for Raspberry Pi User Guide</span> are also UNIX specific. Users should also review the <span class="Name">Dyalog APL Release Notes</span> and the file <span class="Name">dyalog_readme.htm</span>. All of these files and the other Dyalog-supplied documentation can be found in the directory $DYALOG/help, and are available online at http://docs.dyalog.com/<span class="TitlePageVersion">14.0</span>. http://help.dyalog.com/<span class="TitlePageVersion">14.0</span> contains an online help system for the Dyalog APL documentation. These websites are updated from time to time, and have the latest revisions of the documentation.</p></body>
