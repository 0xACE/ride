Many of the user commands which were originally written for running under MicrosoftWindows will run under the various flavours of UNIX.</p><p>Under UNIX there is no autocompletion of user command names.</p><p>The SALT code resides in ⎕SE, which is saved in a session file. The location of the session file is controlled by the environment variable SESSION_FILE; by default this file is $DYALOG/default.dse. Setting SESSION_FILE=/dev/null results in an empty <span class="DyalogPlain">⎕SE</span> and SALT being disabled.</p><p>See the <span class="Name">Dyalog APL User Commands Reference Guide</span> and the <span class="Name">Dyalog APL SALT Reference Guide</span> for more information.</p><h4>Caching User Command information</h4><p>When a Dyalog APL session is started, SALT is loaded, and checks the details of all of the files which contain user commands with a previously cached version of this information. If Dyalog APL has never been run before, or the cache file does not exist, SALT rebuilds the cache file. This can take a few seconds, especially on the Raspberry Pi.</p><p>By default in Version 14.0 the cache file is called <span class="NoHyphenate">~/.dyalog/UserCommand20.cache</span>.</p><p>This can be overridden by specifying the environment variable UCMDCACHEFILE.</p><p>It is expected that the structure of files in ~/.dyalog will change in future versions of Dyalog APL.</p><h4>Assigning Contents of Session Log</h4><p>It is possible to assign the contents of the Session Log to a variable:</p><pre>      z←'⎕se'⎕wg'Log</pre><script src="../../help.js"></script></body>
