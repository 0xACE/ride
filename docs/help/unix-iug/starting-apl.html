<body><h2>Starting APL</h2><p>By default, to start the non-GUI versions of Dyalog APL, run the mapl script which is in the installation directory of Dyalog APL.</p><h4>Example:</h4><pre class="Code">$ /opt/mdyalog/<span class="TitlePageVersion">14.0</span>/64/unicode/mapl</pre><p>The mapl script is supplied so that the user can start to use Dyalog APL immediately once the terminal environment has been setup. However, it should be treated more as a template for creating a startup script more appropriate for the environment and purposes that Dyalog will be used for.</p><p>The startup script usually sets a number of environment variables, and then calls the interpreter with one or more of its parameters. Although all the examples are written using the Korn shell, any shell can be used.</p><p>Note that under Microsoft Windows parameters appear <span class="Italic">after</span> the name of the executable; this is not supported under UNIX, where values must be passed as environment variables.</p><p>The parameters are listed in the table below; the more frequently used environment variables are included in the following section.</p><p class="TableCaption"><span class="autonumber"><span>Table 64: </span></span>Parameters for the mapl script:</p><table><tr><th class="Left">Parameter                </th><th class="Left">Purpose
