<body><h2 class="Newpage">Entering Characters</h2><p>It is necessary to select a metakey which is to be used to enter characters. In this document this metakey is represented by the string “APL”. In a terminal window under a Linux GUI Dyalog recommends using the Windows key as the metakey to generate APL characters; with PuTTY and the Unicode IME the Control key is used (similarly to the Windows Unicode edtion of Dyalog APL). So for example, in a terminal window &lt;WindowsKey&gt;&lt;a&gt;generates an <tt>⍺</tt>; when using PuTTY the same APL character is entered by using &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;a&gt;. [Note that under PuTTY, Ctrl-xcv are reserved for the operating system; we shall see later that Ctrl-x is used for another purpose. Rather than &lt;Ctrl&gt;xcv you must use &lt;Shift+Ctrl&gt;xcv.]
