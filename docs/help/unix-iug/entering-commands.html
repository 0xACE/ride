<body><h2>Entering Commands</h2><p>Commands are either entered using the keys on the keyboard in conjunction with 0 or more metakeys, or when using the keyboard in different modes. A separate keystroke is used to move from one mode to the next; by default this is defined to be Ctrl-x. When Dyalog APL is started, you are in mode 0. With the exception of Move/Resize in the editor/tracer, all mode changes are effective for one keystroke only.
        </p><h4>Example:
        </h4><ul><li value="1">assume that you have just started APL
        </li><li value="2">assume that the WindowsKey is used to enter APL characters
        </li><li value="3">&lt;&gt;represents one keystroke, so &lt;Ctrl+x&gt;&lt;p&gt; means: hit Ctrl+x then p</li></ul><table><tr><th class="Left">Keystrokes entered</th><th class="Left">How described in documentation</th><th class="Left">Outcome in Dyalog APL session</th></tr><tr><td>&lt;p&gt;</td><td>p</td><td>p appears in the session</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;Shift+p&gt;</td><td>P</td><td>P appears in the session</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;WindowKey+p&gt;</td><td>APL p</td><td>* appears in the session</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;WindowsKey+Shift+p&gt;</td><td>APL P</td><td><tt>⍣</tt> appears in the session</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;Ctrl+x&gt;&lt;p&gt;</td><td>Cmd-p</td><td>No noticeable effect.
