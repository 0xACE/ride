<body><h2 class="Newpage">The file command and magic</h2><p>All Dyalog APL binary files have a unique magic number: the first byte is always 0xAA (decimal 170), and the second identifies the type of Dyalog file. Additional bytes may in some cases be used to further identify the type, version and state of the file. UNIX systems include the <span class="Code">file</span> command which use the information in the magic file to describe the contents of files.</p><h3>magic and AIX</h3><p>AIX still uses a very early version of <span class="Code">magic</span>, so it is not possible to give as much information about Dyalog APL files as on Linux.</p><p>Dyalog provides a file, <span class="Code">magic</span>, which is located in the top level installation directory of Dyalog APL. To use this file to extend the capabilities of the <span class="Code">file</span> command either run</p><pre class="Code">file -m /opt/mdyalog/<span class="TitlePageVersion">14.0</span>/32/classic/p5/magic *</pre><p>or catenate the contents of /opt/mdyalog/<span class="TitlePageVersion">14.0</span>/32/classic/p5/magic onto /etc/magic, and then run </p><pre class="Code">file *</pre><h3>Example:</h3><pre class="Code">$ file -m /opt/mdyalog/<span class="TitlePageVersion">14.0</span>/32/classic/p6/magic *

To check whether your Linux distribution has the more recent version, create a journaled component file and then run the file command against that component file. The two examples below show the output with the earlier and later versions of magic in use.</p><h3 class="ExampleNewPage">Example, using the older default magic file:</h3><pre class="Code">$ file *
