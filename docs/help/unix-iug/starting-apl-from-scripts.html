<body><h2>Miscellaneous</h2><h3>Running from scripts</h3><p>Dyalog APL can be run with input being directed from a script file, and output being redirected as well.</p><p>The script file needs to be built in such a way that it contains valid input according to the input translate table that is defined in the APLK variable.</p><p>The classic edition of Dyalog APL expects that the input script by default uses Ctrl-O and Ctrl-N to swap between APL and ASCII characters, and Ctrl-H is used to create overstrikes. Be aware that when editing such an input file, cut and paste of ^H, ^N or ^O may well result in the two character sequences being copied, rather than the single character Ctrl-H, Ctrl-N and Ctrl-O.</p><p>The Unicode edition by default expects that the input file has unicode characters in it; a unicode-aware editor is therefore required. Note however that applications such as Notepad will add BOMs (Byte Order Markers) to the unicode text; these must be removed as the Dyalog APL input translate table does not have BOMs defined in it.</p><p>The example below shows the same set of APL expressions as they would appear in a script file for Classic and Unicode editions: it is rather easier to read the Unicode edition's input !</p><h4>Classic example:</h4><pre>^O(2^NLnqK.K K^OGetBuildID^NK^O),(^NK.KLwgK^OAPLVersion^NK^O)
