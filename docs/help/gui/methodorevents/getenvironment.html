If a value is defined in several places (for example, MAXWS in the command line overriding MAXWS in the registry), GetEnvironment follows exactly the same logic as is used by Dyalog APL itself and so obtains the same value.</p><p>The argument to GetEnvironment is a single item as follows:</p><table><tr><td><tt>[1]</tt></td><td>Parameter name(s)</td><td>see below</td></tr></table><p><span class="Italic">Parameter names</span> is simple character vector or vector of character vectors specifying one or more parameters.</p><p>The result is a simple character vector or a vector of character vectors.</p><p>Examples:</p><pre>      GetEnvironment 'MAXWS'
