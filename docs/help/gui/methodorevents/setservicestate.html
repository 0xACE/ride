See <a href="../../userguide/installation-and-configuration/apl-application-as-a-service.html#A4S" class="MCXref_0">APL Application as a Service</a>.</p><p>The argument to the SetServiceState method is the desired state of the service. This should be one of the following numeric values:</p><table style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td>SERVICE_STOPPED</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>SERVICE_RUNNING</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>SERVICE_PAUSED</td><td>7</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The state of a Windows service is determined by the user and the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM).</p><p>When the SCM requests a change of state, the APL interpreter responds by setting its state to the corresponding <span class="Name">pending</span> level (SERVICE_STOPPED_PENDING, SERVICE_RUNNING_PENDING or SERVICE_PAUSED_PENDING) and then generates a <a href="servicenotification.html">ServiceNotification</a> event.</p><p> It is the responsibility of the APL service to process this event, perform the appropriate application tasks, and then respond (to the SCM) by calling the <a href="#">SetServiceState</a> method to confirm that the service has reached the desired state.</p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
