The new <a href="../objects/tcpsocket.html">TCPSocket</a> object must be created by cloning the original listening socket. This is done by specifying the socket handle as the value of its SocketNumber property. You may not specify any other properties (except Event and Data) in the <tt>⎕WC</tt> statement that creates the new clone object.</p><p>The default processing for this event is to close the socket handle reported by the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> element of the event message <b>unless</b> it has been associated with a new <a href="../objects/tcpsocket.html">TCPSocket</a> object by the callback function as described above. You may prevent this from occurring by returning 0 from a callback function. This may be necessary in a multithreaded application.</p><p>You may not call TCPClose as a method or generate this event artificially using <tt>⎕NQ</tt>.</p></body>
