This event occurs only in a <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a> whose <a href="../props/vscroll.html">VScroll</a> property is set to <tt>¯1</tt> and is distinct from the <a href="scroll.html">Scroll</a> event which is generated by a <a href="../objects/scroll.html">Scroll</a> object. The event may be generated in one of three ways :</p><ol><li value="1">dragging the thumb</li><li value="2">clicking in one of the "arrow" buttons situated at the ends of the scrollbar. This is termed a small change, the size of which is defined by <a href="../props/step.html">Step</a>[1].</li><li value="3">clicking in the body of the scrollbar.
