This may be done by dragging a border with the mouse or by double-clicking over a border.

In the latter case, the default action is to adjust the height to the maximum required to display all the data.</p><p>In either case, you can disable the default action by setting the event action code to <tt>¯1</tt> or you can selectively prevent a particular resize operation from taking place by returning 0 from a callback function.</p><p>The event message reported as the result of <a href="../../lang/sysfns/dq.html"><tt>⎕DQ</tt></a>, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 5-element vector as follows :</p><table class="Event"><tr><td><tt>[1]</tt></td><td>Object</td><td>ref or character vector</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[2]</tt></td><td>Event</td><td><tt>'SelRowSize'</tt> or 175</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[3]</tt></td><td>Row number</td><td>Integer.

If you specify a value of <tt>¯2</tt> the row will be resized to fit the data.
