<body><h2><tt>Event 164</tt>CellChanged</h2><table class="GUIMembers"><tr><td class="SpacedPlainTitle">Applies To:</td><td class="SpacedPlain"><a href="../objects/grid.html">Grid</a></td></tr></table><p class="Bold">Description</p><p>If enabled, this event is reported after the user has changed the contents of a cell in a <a href="../objects/grid.html">Grid</a> object and then moved to another cell or to another control outside the <a href="../objects/grid.html">Grid</a>. The purpose of this event is to give the application the opportunity to perform calculations, and perhaps to update other cells in the <a href="../objects/grid.html">Grid</a> as a result of the change.</p><p>Note that this event is reported <b>after</b> the change has taken place, and after the <a href="../props/values.html">Values</a> property has been updated. Furthermore, neither setting the event action code to <tt>¯1</tt> nor returning 0 from a callback function has any effect. If you wish to <span class="Italic">validate</span> the new data you should use the <a href="cellchange.html">CellChange</a> (150) event instead.</p><p>The event message reported as the result of <a href="../../lang/sysfns/dq.html"><tt>⎕DQ</tt></a>, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is an 5-element vector as follows:</p><table class="Event"><tr><td><tt>[1]</tt></td><td>Object</td><td>ref or character vector</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[2]</tt></td><td>Event</td><td><tt>'CellChanged'</tt> or 164</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[3]</tt></td><td>Cell row</td><td>integer</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[4]</tt></td><td>Cell column</td><td>integer</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[5]</tt></td><td>New data</td><td>number or character array</td></tr></table><p>The 5th element of the event message contains the data value that has been used to update the <a href="../props/values.html">Values</a> property. This will be numeric if the <a href="../props/fieldtype.html">FieldType</a> of the associated Edit object is Numeric, LongNumeric, Date, LongDate or Time. Otherwise, it will be a character array.</p><p>If you want to update an individual cell under program control, you may call <a href="cellchange.html">CellChange</a> , but not CellChanged, as a method.</p></body>
