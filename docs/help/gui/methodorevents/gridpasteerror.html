there is data in the clipboard, but the system is unable to paste the data into
the <a href="../objects/grid.html">Grid</a>. This occurs if there is a currently
selected block of cells whose shape does not match the shape of the data in the
clipboard. It also occurs if there is no selected block of cells, and pasting
the data in starting at the current cell (CurCell) would overflow the <a href="../objects/grid.html">Grid</a>.
