For a <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a> or <a href="../objects/subform.html">SubForm</a>, the event may be generated by the user selecting "Close" from its System Menu. In this case, the event is reported <b>before</b> the window is destroyed, and you may prevent it from going ahead by associating a callback function which returns a result of 0.</p><p>By trapping this event you can control termination of your application in many different ways. For example, you could:</p><ul><li value="1">automatically close all <a href="../objects/form.html">Forms</a> in your application when the master <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a> is closed.</li><li value="2">prevent the user from terminating the application if it is inappropriate at that time.</li><li value="3">display an "Are you sure ?" <a href="../objects/msgbox.html">MsgBox</a>.</li></ul><p>The event message reported as the result of <a href="../../lang/sysfns/dq.html"><tt>âŽ•DQ</tt></a>, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function is a 2-element vector as follows :</p><table class="Event"><tr><td><tt>[1]</tt></td><td>Object</td><td>ref or character vector</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[2]</tt></td><td>Event</td><td><tt>'Close'</tt> or 33</td></tr></table><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
