The default action of the event is to copy the contents of the clipboard into the currently selected block of cells, or, if no cells are selected, into the block of cells starting at the current cell (CurCell). Note that if there is a selected range of cells and the shape of the data being pasted does not exactly match the size of the selected range, the system generates a <a href="gridpasteerror.html">GridPasteError</a> event in addition to the GridPaste event.</p><p>You may disable the paste facility entirely by setting the action code of the event to <tt>¯1</tt>.

If you omit <span class="Italic">Start</span>, data is pasted into the currently selected range of cells. If there are no cells selected, data is pasted starting at the current cell (CurCell). In either case, the block of replaced cells becomes selected.</p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
