The name displayed for a Dyalog APL/W application is defined by the <a href="../props/caption.html">Caption</a> property of the system object <tt>Root</tt>. If you fail to define this property, there will be no entry for the application in the Task List.</p><p>If you wish to prevent the user from terminating your application from the Windows Task List, you may disable this event by setting its action code to <tt>¯1</tt>. However, if you do this, your user may be puzzled as to why the operation does not work as expected. An alternative is to attach a callback function to the event which displays a message box. Not only does this allow you to provide user feedback, but you can provide confirm/cancel options. If your callback function returns a zero, your application will not be terminated.</p><p>Note that this event only provides for termination via the Windows Task List. See also the <a href="exitwindows.html">ExitWindows</a> event.</p><p>The event message reported as the result of <a href="../../lang/sysfns/dq.html"><tt>⎕DQ</tt></a>, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 2-element vector as follows :</p><table class="Event"><tr><td><tt>[1]</tt></td><td>Object</td><td>ref or character vector</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[2]</tt></td><td>Event</td><td><tt>'ExitApp'</tt> or 132</td></tr></table></body>
