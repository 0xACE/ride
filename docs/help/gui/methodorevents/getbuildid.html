single item as follows:</p><table><tr><td><tt>[1]</tt></td><td>File name</td><td>character vector</td></tr></table><p>The (shy) result is an 8-element character vector of hexadecimal digits that
represents the Build ID.</p><p>If the argument is <tt>⍬</tt>, the build id is
that of the current version of Dyalog APL that is running the expression.</p><p>Note that although this method is designed to uniquely identify different
versions of Dyalog APL by its checksum, it may be used to obtain a checksum
for <span class="Italic">any</span> arbitrary file.</p><h4>Examples:</h4><pre>      GetBuildID ⍬
