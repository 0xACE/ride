This action also generates PageNext (or PageBack) and PageDeactivate and PageActivate events. The SetWizard event is the final event to be reported as a result of this action, and is the only one that is affected by the result of a callback function. The event message reports the active/inactive state of the 3 page changing buttons (Back, Next and Finish) that should result from the action. Note that the Next and Finish buttons occupy the same position and are mutually exclusive.</p><p>The event message reported as the result of <tt>⎕DQ</tt>, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 5-element vector as follows :</p><table class="Event"><tr><td><tt>[1]</tt></td><td>Object</td><td>ref or character vector</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[2]</tt></td><td>Event</td><td><tt>'SetWizard'</tt> or 365</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[3]</tt></td><td>Active state Back</td><td>0 or 1</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[4]</tt></td><td>Active state Next</td><td>0 or 1</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[5]</tt></td><td>Active state Finish</td><td>0 or 1</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[6]</tt></td><td>Finish caption</td><td>character vector</td></tr></table><p>You may alter the state of the buttons by changing elements [3-5] of the event message and returning it as a result of your callback. You may also set the state of the buttons at any time by calling SetWizard as a method.</p><p>When the event is reported by <tt>⎕DQ</tt>, element 6 is an empty vector. If you modify it and return it in the result of a callback, the caption of the Finish button changes accordingly and the Back and Next buttons disappear. This happens regardless of the states you specified in elements [3-5].</p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
