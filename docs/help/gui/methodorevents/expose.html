Under normal circumstances, APL repaints the exposed region automatically. However, if you have drawn unnamed graphical objects (which are <b>not</b> managed by APL) you should use this event to redraw them when required. Note that APL will itself repaint any <b>named</b> objects in the region before reporting the event. </p><p>The event message reported as the result of <a href="../../lang/sysfns/dq.html"><tt>⎕DQ</tt></a>, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 6-element vector as follows :</p><table class="Event"><tr><td><tt>[1]</tt></td><td>Object</td><td>ref or character vector</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[2]</tt></td><td>Event</td><td><tt>'Expose'</tt> or 32</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[3]</tt></td><td>Y</td><td>y-position of top-left corner of exposed region</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[4]</tt></td><td>X</td><td>x-position of top-left corner of exposed region</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[5]</tt></td><td>H</td><td>height of exposed region</td></tr><tr><td><tt>[6]</tt></td><td>W</td><td>width of exposed region</td></tr></table><p>This event <b>cannot</b> be disabled by setting its action code to <tt>¯1</tt>. Similarly, setting the result of a callback function to 0 has no effect on it.</p></body>
