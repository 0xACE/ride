Each pane created this way may be empty or be occupied by a single object. If the object in a pane is itself a container object, such as a <a href="subform.html">SubForm</a>, it may have a number of other controls within it.</p><p>A single Splitter may manage the geometry of 0, 1 or 2 other objects, which, together with the Splittter itself, share the same parent. The two objects are named by the <a href="../props/splitobj1.html">SplitObj1</a> and <a href="../props/splitobj2.html">SplitObj2</a> properties respectively.</p><p>A Splitter may manage objects of the following types:</p><table><tr><td>Button</td><td>Calendar</td><td>Combo</td><td>Edit</td><td>Grid</td><td>Group </td></tr><tr><td>Label</td><td>List</td><td>ListView</td><td>MDIClient</td><td>ProgressBar</td><td>RichEdit </td></tr><tr><td>Scroll</td><td>Spinner</td><td>Static</td><td>StatusBar</td><td>SubForm</td><td>TabBar </td></tr><tr><td>TabControl</td><td>ToolBar</td><td>TrackBar</td><td>TreeView</td><td>UpDown</td><td> </td></tr></table><br /><p>If <a href="../props/style.html">Style</a> is <tt>'Vert'</tt> (the default), the Splitter is drawn vertically in its parent with the first object (<a href="../props/splitobj1.html">SplitObj1</a>) positioned to its left, and the second object (<a href="../props/splitobj2.html">SplitObj2</a>) to its right. <a href="../examples/splitter-example-1.html" class="MCXref_SeeExample_0"> See Splitter: Example 1.</a></p><p>If <a href="../props/style.html">Style</a> is <tt>'Horz'</tt>, the Splitter is drawn horizontally in its parent with the first object (<a href="../props/splitobj1.html">SplitObj1</a>) positioned above, and the second object (<a href="../props/splitobj2.html">SplitObj2</a>) below.<a href="../examples/splitter-example-2.html" class="MCXref_SeeExample_0"> See Splitter: Example 2.</a></p><p>The <a href="../props/style.html">Style</a> property must be set when the object is created with <tt>⎕WC</tt> and may not subsequently be changed using <tt>⎕WS</tt>.</p><p>The <a href="../props/posn.html">Posn</a> and <a href="../props/size.html">Size</a> properties are partially read-only, in that only one dimension of the value may be specified. If <a href="../props/style.html">Style</a> is <tt>'Vert'</tt>, you may specify the x-coordinate and the width of the Splitter, but you may not specify its y- coordinate nor its height. If <a href="../props/style.html">Style</a> is <tt>'Horz'</tt>, you may specify the y-coordinate and the width of the Splitter, but you may not specify its x-coordinate nor its length.</p><p>When the user positions the mouse pointer directly over the Splitter object, the cursor changes (by default) to a double-headed arrow (direction in accordance with <a href="../props/style.html">Style</a>). The user may now depress the left mouse button and drag the Splitter to a new position, resizing the objects named by <a href="../props/splitobj1.html">SplitObj1</a> and <a href="../props/splitobj2.html">SplitObj2</a> in the process. </p><p>You can select a different cursor using the CursorObj property. Note that setting the CursorObj property to 0 selects the default cursor, which is the appropriate double-headed arrow.</p><p>When the user depresses the mouse button, the Splitter generates a <a href="../methodorevents/startsplit.html">StartSplit</a> event. When the user releases the mouse button, the Splitter generates an <a href="../methodorevents/endsplit.html">EndSplit</a> event. If full-drag is in effect, the Splitter also reports <a href="../methodorevents/splitting.html">Splitting</a> events as it is dragged. All these events report the new or current position of the Splitter object and are provided for information only.</p><p>Note that the objects named by <a href="../props/splitobj1.html">SplitObj1</a> and <a href="../props/splitobj2.html">SplitObj2</a> and any sub-objects they contain will generate Configure events when they are resized by the Splitter.</p><h4>Alignment</h4><p>The <a href="../props/align.html">Align</a> property specifies how a Splitter behaves when its parent is resized and may be <tt>'None'</tt>, <tt>'Left'</tt>, <tt>'Right'</tt>, <tt>'Top'</tt> or <tt>'Bottom'</tt>.</p><p>If <a href="../props/align.html">Align</a> is <tt>'None'</tt>, the Splitter moves as its parent is resized, so that it divides its parent in the same <span class="Italic">proportions</span> as before. This is the default.</p><p>Any other value of <a href="../props/align.html">Align</a> attaches the Splitter to the corresponding edge of its parent. For example, if <a href="../props/align.html">Align</a> is <tt>'Left'</tt>, the width of the object to the <span class="Italic">left</span> of the Splitter remains fixed when its parent is resized horizontally by the user. </p><p>Like the <a href="../props/style.html">Style</a> property, <a href="../props/align.html">Align</a> may be set only when the object is created with <tt>⎕WC</tt> and may not subsequently be changed using <tt>⎕WS</tt>.</p><h4>Using Multiple Splitters</h4><p>If you want to divide a Form into more than 2 resizable panes, there are two possible approaches, each with its own different characteristics.</p><p>The first approach is a hierarchical one using SubForms. This example shows how you can create a Form containing three resizable Edit objects. </p><p>First, you create an Edit, a SubForm, and a Splitter as children of the <span class="Italic">Form</span>, using the Splitter to divide the Form into two panes, one for the Edit and the other for the SubForm. Next, you create two Edit objects and a Splitter as children of the <span class="Italic">SubForm</span>, using the second Splitter to divide the SubForm into two. You can continue with this approach to any reasonable depth. <a href="../examples/splitter-example-3.html" class="MCXref_SeeExample_0"> See Splitter: Example 3.</a></p><p>Notice that, by default, when the first Splitter is shifted to the left, both panes in the SubForm expand equally.</p><p>The second approach is to create multiple Splitters <span class="Italic">at the same level</span>, i.e. owned by the same parent. <a href="../examples/splitter-example-4.html" class="MCXref_SeeExample_0"> See Splitter: Example 4.</a></p><p>In this case, the third Edit object <tt>F.E3</tt> is unaffected by movement of the leftmost Splitter <tt>F.S1</tt>. Note also, that the first Splitter <tt>F.S1</tt> may not be dragged further right than the second Splitter <tt>F.S2</tt>.</p><p>Using the non-hierarchical approach, horizontal and vertical Splitters may be combined in interesting ways. This can also be achieved using nested SubForms, but at the expense of a complex object hierarchy.<a href="../examples/splitter-example-5.html" class="MCXref_SeeExample_0"> See Splitter: Example 5.</a></p><p>Notice that in this example, with the exception of the last Splitter <tt>F.S4</tt>, it is necessary only to specify the <a href="../props/splitobj1.html">SplitObj1</a> property for each of the Splitters. The reason is that the first four Splitters only manage one object <span class="Italic">directly</span>. For example, the object to the right of <tt>F.S1</tt> is in fact a horizontal Splitter <tt>F.S2</tt>. Dragging <tt>F.S1</tt> changes the length of <tt>F.S2</tt> which in turn changes the width of <tt>F.E2</tt>. and <tt>F.E3</tt>.</p><h4>Colliding Splitters</h4><p>If you have two or more vertical Splitters or two or more horizontal Splitters in the same parent object, it is possible for the user to make the Splitters <span class="Italic">collide</span>. This can occur by dragging one of the Splitters into the other, or, unless both Splitters have Align set to <tt>'None'</tt>, by shrinking the parent.</p><p>When Splitters collide, the object being dragged by the user (a Splitter or a border of the parent) takes precedence over the setting of Align, and temporarily <span class="Italic">pushes</span> other Splitters along in its direction of travel. If and when the operation is reversed, the other Splitters are <span class="Italic">pulled</span> back to their original positions.</p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
