<body><h2><tt>Property</tt>Coord</h2><p class="Bold"><span class="MCPopup"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="FMCPopup( event, this ); return false;" class="MCPopupSpot">Applies To</a></span></p><p class="Bold">Description</p><p>This property defines an object's co-ordinate system. It is a character
string with one of the following values;<tt> 'Inherit'</tt>,
<tt>'Prop'</tt>, <tt>'Pixel'</tt>,
<tt>'User'</tt> or<tt> 'Cell'</tt>(graphics children of a <a href="../objects/grid.html">Grid</a> only).</p><p>If Coord is <tt>'Inherit'</tt>, the co-ordinate
system for the object is <b>inherited</b> from its parent. Note that the default
value of Coord for the system object <tt>'.'</tt>is <tt>'Prop'</tt>, so by default all objects
created by <a href="../../lang/sysfns/wc.html"><tt>⎕WC</tt></a> inherit <tt>'Prop'</tt>.</p><p>If Coord is <tt>'Prop'</tt>, the origin of the
object's parent is deemed to be at its top left interior corner, and the scale
along its x- and y-axes is 100. The object's position and size (<a href="posn.html">Posn</a> and <a href="size.html">Size</a> properties) are therefore specified
and reported as a percentage of the dimensions of the parent object, or, for a <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a>,
of the screen.</p><p>If Coord is <tt>'Pixel'</tt>, the origin of the
object's parent is deemed to be at its top left interior corner, and the scale
along its x- and y-axes is measured in physical pixel units. The object's size
and position (<a href="posn.html">Posn</a> and <a href="size.html">Size</a> properties) are therefore reported and set in physical pixel units. If you set
Coord on the system object to <tt>'Pixel'</tt>, the
value of its <a href="size.html">Size</a> property gives you the
resolution of your screen, e.g. (480,640). Note that pixels are numbered from 0
to (Size -1).</p><p>If Coord is <tt>'User'</tt>, the origin and
scale of the co-ordinate system are defined by the values of the <a href="yrange.html">YRange</a> and <a href="xrange.html">XRange</a> properties <b>of the parent
object</b>. Each of these is a 2-element numeric vector whose elements define
the co-ordinates of top left and bottom right interior corners of the (parent)
object respectively.</p><p>Note that if Coord is <tt>'User'</tt> and you
change the values of <a href="yrange.html">YRange</a> and/or <a href="xrange.html">XRange</a> of the parent, the object (and all its siblings with Coord <tt>'User'</tt>)
are redrawn (and clipped) according to the new origin and scale defined for the
parent. The values of their <a href="posn.html">Posn</a>, <a href="size.html">Size</a> and <a href="points.html">Points</a> properties are unaffected.
Changing <a href="range.html">YRange</a> and/or <a href="range.html">XRange</a> therefore provides a convenient and efficient means to "<b>pan and zoom</b>".</p><p>The Coord property for graphic objects created as a children of a Grid may
also be set to Cell. Apart from being easier to compute, a graphic drawn using
cell coordinates will expand and contract when the grid rows and columns are
resized.</p><h4>Example:</h4><p>This statement creates a button 10 pixels high, 20 pixels wide, and 5 pixels
down and along from the top-left corner of the parent <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a>.</p><pre>      'TEST.B1'⎕WC'Button' 'OK'(5 5)(10 20)('Coord' 'Pixel')</pre><p>If you set Coord to <tt>'Pixel'</tt> in the <a href="../objects/root.html">Root</a> object <tt>'.'</tt>, then query its <a href="size.html">Size</a>,
you get the dimensions of the screen in pixels, i.e.</p><pre>      '.' ⎕WS 'Coord' 'Pixel'
