<body><h2><tt>Property</tt>Sizeable</h2><p class="Bold"><span class="MCPopup"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="FMCPopup( event, this ); return false;" class="MCPopupSpot">Applies To</a></span></p><p class="Bold">Description</p><p>This property determines whether or not an object can be directly resized by the user once it has been created by <a href="../../lang/sysfns/wc.html"><tt>竡標C</tt></a>.</p><p>It is a single number with the value 0 (the object cannot be resized by the user) or 1 (the object may be resized by the user). The default is 1.</p><p>For a <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a> or <a href="../objects/subform.html">SubForm</a>, the Sizeable property may only be set by <a href="../../lang/sysfns/wc.html"><tt>竡標C</tt></a> and cannot subsequently be altered using <a href="../../lang/sysfns/ws.html"><tt>竡標S</tt></a>. An attempt to do so generates a <tt>NONCE ERROR</tt>. For a <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a>, the default value is 1 and the <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a> occupies a standard resizeable window with a border. Note that the value of Sizeable is independent of the values of the <a href="maxbutton.html">MaxButton</a> and <a href="minbutton.html">MinButton</a> properties, so that a <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a> with <a href="maxbutton.html">MaxButton</a> 1 can be maximised even though its Sizeable property is 0.</p><p>For other objects, the default value of the Sizeable property is 0. However, setting it to 1 (which may be done dynamically using <a href="../../lang/sysfns/ws.html"><tt>竡標S</tt></a>) allows the user to resize it with the mouse.</p><p>In all these cases, when the user resizes an object, the object will generate a <a href="../methodorevents/configure.html">Configure</a> (31) event.</p><p>Sizeable also applies to the <a href="../objects/locator.html">Locator</a> object. In this case, a value of 1 implies "rubberbanding" and a value of 0 means "no rubberbanding". See <a href="../objects/locator.html">Locator</a> object for further details.</p></body>
