If so, "new-line" characters are appended to each row of the matrix, or to each vector in a vector of vectors, before being displayed. The user may insert or add a "new-line" character in a multi-line <a href="../objects/edit.html">Edit</a> by pressing Ctrl-Enter (Enter itself is used to press <a href="../objects/button.html">Button</a>s).</p><p>Note that if word-wrapping is in effect in a multi-line <a href="../objects/edit.html">Edit</a> object, the structure of Text does not correspond to the lines displayed.</p><p>In a <a href="../objects/text.html">Text</a> object, the value of the Text property may be a simple scalar, an enclosed vector or matrix, a simple vector, a simple matrix, or a vector of enclosed vectors or matrices.</p><p>In general, the value of Text returned by <a href="../../lang/sysfns/wg.html"><tt>竡標G</tt></a> has the same structure that was assigned to it by <a href="../../lang/sysfns/wc.html"><tt>竡標C</tt></a> or by the most recent call to <a href="../../lang/sysfns/ws.html"><tt>竡標S</tt></a>. New-Line characters are removed.</p><p>You can copy text into the Windows <a href="../objects/clipboard.html">Clipboard</a> by using <a href="../../lang/sysfns/ws.html"><tt>竡標S</tt></a> to set Text for a <a href="../objects/clipboard.html">Clipboard</a> object. In this case you may specify a simple character scalar, vector or matrix, or a vector of character vectors. If you are retrieving data from the clipboard that has been stored by another application, Text will be either a character vector or a vector of character vectors.</p><p>The Text property of a <a href="../objects/statusfield.html">StatusField</a> is updated automatically if its <a href="style.html">Style</a> property is set to monitor the status of a key.</p></body>
