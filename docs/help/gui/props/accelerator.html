generate a <a href="../methodorevents/select.html">Select</a> event on an object. It
applies to all objects whether or not they posses a "natural" <a href="../methodorevents/select.html">Select</a>
 event. You can therefore associate a keystroke with an arbitrary action on any
object you desire.</p><p>The Accelerator property is a 2-element integer vector. The first element is
a key number which is the number by which Windows <span class="Italic">knows</span> the key. The
second element is the shift state which is the sum of 1 (Shift key), 2 (Control
key) and 4 (Alt key).</p><p>For example, to attach the keystroke Ctrl+A to an object, you would set its
Accelerator to (65 2). To attach the keystroke Shift+Ctrl+F1 (key number 112),
you would set its Accelerator to (112 3). Key numbers may be obtained by
displaying the messages generated by the <a href="../methodorevents/keypress.html">KeyPress</a>
 event.</p><p>Note that a keystroke used as an Accelerator will <b>not</b> generate a <a href="../methodorevents/keypress.html">KeyPress</a>
 event.</p></body>
