<body><h2><tt>Property</tt>Yield</h2><table class="GUIMembers"><tr><td class="SpacedPlainTitle">Applies To:</td><td class="SpacedPlain"><a href="../objects/root.html">Root</a></td></tr></table><p class="Bold">Description</p><p>This property specifies the frequency with which APL <span class="Italic">yields</span> to Windows and applies mainly to Version 7. Multi-tasking in Windows 3.x is implemented by task switching between applications whenever any application requests a message from the queue. An application that is purely performing computational or file-handling tasks will therefore prevent all other applications from running. Well-behaved Windows applications should <span class="Italic">yield</span> control by requesting a message periodically even though no user interaction is currently taking place. However, this operation takes a perceptible length of time, even if no other applications are running.</p><p>By default, Dyalog APL/W yields control to Windows approximately every 1/5th of a second. This is implemented by checking the time at the beginning of each line of executable APL code and yielding if 1/5th of a second or more has elapsed since the last yield. This mechanism also allows APL to detect user interrupts (which are simply Windows messages) during the execution of code.</p><p>In most circumstances yielding every 1/5th of a second produces "good" Windows behaviour with little impact on APL throughput. However, in some cases it may be beneficial to use the Yield property to explicitly control the yield frequency. An example is in an application that takes an appreciable time to redraw an existing graphical picture. If APL yields before the entire picture has been redrawn, some objects will be erased before others are redrawn, causing a flickering effect.</p><p>The value of Yield is an integer expressed in 1/1000's of a second. Its default value is 200. Yield defines the period of time allowed to elapse between the execution of successive lines of APL code before APL yields to Windows by requesting a message from the Windows queue. If Yield is set to zero APL does not explicitly yield.</p><p>Note that the value of this property only controls the yield frequency when APL is executing user-defined code. APL may also yield implicitly during <a href="../../lang/sysfns/dq.html"><tt>⎕DQ</tt></a>, <a href="../../lang/sysfns/nq.html"><tt>⎕NQ</tt></a>, <a href="../../lang/sysfns/wc.html"><tt>⎕WC</tt></a>, <tt>⎕SR</tt>, <a href="../../lang/sysfns/ws.html"><tt>⎕WS</tt></a> and <a href="../../lang/sysfns/wg.html"><tt>⎕WG</tt></a> and in communicating with Auxiliary processors. Note that setting Yield to 0 (or to a very high value) during the execution of code that does not implicitly yield will effectively de-activate all other applications (including Program manager) and disable APL interrupts (Ctrl+Break). It should therefore be used with extreme caution.</p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
