Furthermore, it must be specified in the <tt>⎕WC</tt> statement that creates the <a href="../objects/tcpsocket.html">TCPSocket</a> object and it may not subsequently be changed using <tt>⎕WS</tt>.</p><p>You may use either RemoteAddr or <a href="remoteaddrname.html">RemoteAddrName</a> to identify the remote computer. If you know its IP address, it is normally quicker to specify RemoteAddr. If you specify both properties, the value of <a href="remoteaddrname.html">RemoteAddrName</a> will be ignored.</p><p>For a server <a href="../objects/tcpsocket.html">TCPSocket</a>, RemoteAddr is determined by the IP address of the connecting process and is a read-only property.</p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
