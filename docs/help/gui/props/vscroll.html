It is a single integer with the value <tt>¯2</tt>, <tt>¯1</tt>, or 0.</p><p class="Bold">VScroll may only be set when the object is created with <tt>⎕WC</tt> and may not subsequently be changed with <tt>⎕WS</tt> or assignment.</p><p>For a <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a> object, the value <tt>¯1</tt>  specifies that the <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a> has a vertical scrollbar. A value of 0 (which is the default) means that it does not.</p><p>When applied to an <a href="../objects/edit.html">Edit</a> object, the value <tt>¯2</tt> specifies that the data is scrollable vertically, but only by using the cursor keys; a scrollbar is not provided. A value of <tt>¯1</tt> causes a scrollbar to be displayed (whether or not one is needed).</p><p>When applied to a <a href="../objects/list.html">List</a> object, the value <tt>¯2</tt> specifies that the data is scrollable vertically, but only by using the cursor keys; a scrollbar is not provided. A value of <tt>¯1</tt> causes a scrollbar to be displayed if required (when the list of items exceeds the height of the object).</p><p>When applied to a <a href="../objects/combo.html">Combo</a> or <a href="../objects/comboex.html">ComboEx</a> object, a value of <tt>¯1</tt> or <tt>¯2</tt> causes a scrollbar to be displayed, whether or not one is required.</p><p>For all these objects, a value of 0 inhibits scrolling altogether.</p><p>For a <a href="../objects/scroll.html">Scroll</a> object, VScroll may be <tt>¯1</tt> or 0. If it is <tt>¯1</tt> the direction of the scrollbar is vertical. If both <a href="hscroll.html">HScroll</a> and VScroll are set to <tt>¯1</tt>, <a href="hscroll.html">HScroll</a> takes precedence and forces VScroll back to 0.</p><p>For a <a href="../objects/statusbar.html">StatusBar</a>, <a href="../objects/tabbar.html">TabBar</a> or <a href="../objects/toolbar.html">ToolBar</a> with <a href="align.html">Align</a> set to Left or Right, VScroll determines whether or not a vertical scrollbar is provided and how the object positions its children. If VScroll is 0 (the default) the object organises its children in multiple columns and does not provide a scrollbar. If VScroll is <tt>¯1</tt> or <tt>¯2</tt>, the object organises its children in a single column and provides a mini scrollbar to allow those positioned beyond the bottom edge of the object to be scrolled into view. If VScroll is <tt>¯1</tt>, the scrollbar is always shown. If VScroll is <tt>¯2</tt>, it is only shown when needed.</p><p>For a <a href="../objects/grid.html">Grid</a>, VScroll may be 0 (no vertical scrollbar), <tt>¯1</tt> (scrollbar is displayed when required), <tt>¯2</tt> (same as <tt>¯1</tt>) or <tt>¯3</tt> (scrollbar is always displayed).</p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
