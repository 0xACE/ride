For example, the Type of a Button will change from <tt>'Button'</tt> to <tt>'Namespace'</tt>. Effectively, the GUI component of the object is discarded but its Namespace component (and any variables, functions, operators and other namespaces that it contains) remains intact. Monadic <tt>⎕WC</tt> may subsequently be used to re-attach the GUI component to the object.</p><p>Note that the default value of KeepOnClose depends upon the way in which a GUI object was created with <tt>⎕WC</tt>. If a GUI object is created by dyadic <tt>⎕WC</tt>, KeepOnClose defaults to 0. If a GUI object is attached by monadic <tt>⎕WC</tt>, its KeepOnClose property defaults to 1.</p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
