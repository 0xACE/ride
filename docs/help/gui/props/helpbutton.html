However, this does not apply if the Form has a maximise or minimise button which both take precedence. The user may obtain help by clicking on the Question (?) button and then on a control in the Form. It is up to you to provide the help by responding to the <a href="../methodorevents/help.html">Help</a> event on the control. The default value of HelpButton is 0.</p></body>
