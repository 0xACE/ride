If instead it has the value <tt>¯2</tt>, the field is scrollable, and the length of data that may be entered is not limited by the length of the field.</p><p>When applied to an <a href="../objects/edit.html">Edit</a> object with <a href="style.html">Style</a><tt>'Multi'</tt> (i.e. a multi-line text box), the value 0 inhibits scrolling, and causes individual lines to be "word-wrapped". The values <tt>¯2</tt> and <tt>¯1</tt> enable sideways scrolling, and permit individual lines to exceed the width of the object. The value <tt>¯1</tt> means that a horizontal scrollbar is provided.</p><p>For a <a href="../objects/scroll.html">Scroll</a> object, the scrollbar is horizontal if HScroll is <tt>¯1</tt> and vertical if HScroll is 0. For a <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a>, a horizontal scrollbar is provided if HScroll is set to <tt>¯1</tt>. The default value is 0 (no scrollbar).</p><p>For a <a href="../objects/statusbar.html">StatusBar</a>, <a href="../objects/tabbar.html">TabBar</a> or <a href="../objects/toolbar.html">ToolBar</a> with <a href="align.html">Align</a> set to Top or Bottom, HScroll determines whether or not a horizontal scrollbar is provided and how the object positions its children. If HScroll is 0 (the default) the object organises its children in multiple rows and does not provide a scrollbar. If HScroll is <tt>¯1</tt> or <tt>¯2</tt>, the object organises its children in a single row and provides a mini scrollbar to allow those positioned beyond the right edge of the object to be scrolled into view. If HScroll is <tt>¯1</tt>, the scrollbar is always shown. If HScroll is <tt>¯2</tt>, it is only shown when needed.</p><p>For a <a href="../objects/grid.html">Grid</a>, HScroll may be <tt>0</tt> (no horizontal scrollbar), <tt>¯1</tt> (scrollbar is displayed when required), <tt>¯2</tt> (same as <tt>¯1</tt>) or <tt>¯3</tt> (scrollbar is always displayed).</p></body>
