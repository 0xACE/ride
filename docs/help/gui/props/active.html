It is a single number with the value 0 (object is inactive and does not generate events) or 1 (object is active and capable of generating events). The default is 1.</p><p>Setting Active to 0 disables the object (and all its children), even though the object may be referenced in the argument to <a href="../../lang/sysfns/dq.html"><tt>âŽ•DQ</tt></a>. It is therefore possible to deactivate an object from a callback function.</p><p>In general, the text associated with an object whose Active property is 0 is displayed in grey.</p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
