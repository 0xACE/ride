Its default value is 0 which obtains the colour defined for Window text.</p><p>The grid lines may be removed by setting GridFCol to the same colour as the background colour of the cells, which is defined by <a href="bcol.html#BCol_Property">BCol</a>.</p><p>Finer control of the colour of the grid lines can be achieved by using <a href="gridlinefcol.html#GridLineFCol_Property">GridLineFCol</a> instead.</p><p>Unlike <a href="gridlinefcol.html#GridLineFCol_Property">GridLineFCol</a>, the value of GridFCol is ignored when <span class="Name">Native Look and Feel</span> is enabled; the colour is taken from the current theme.</p></body>
