In versions of Dyalog APL for other platforms, it has no effect.</p><p>This is a Boolean property that specifies the behaviour of the Input Panel with respect to the Pocket APL GUI.</p><p>If SIPMode is 1, the Input Panel is automatically displayed when a GUI control that may receive character input (e.g. an Edit object) receives the input focus. The Input Panel is automatically hidden when the input focus moves to a control that does not receive character input.</p><p>If SIPMode is 0 (the default), the display of the Input Panel is not handled automatically, but may be controlled using the ShowSIP method.</p><p>Note that the user may display and hide the Input Panel manually, regardless of the value of SIPMode.</p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
