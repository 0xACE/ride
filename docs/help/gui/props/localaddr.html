Its default value is <tt>'0:0:0:0'</tt> which refers to your default IP address.</p><p>Unless your computer has more than one network adapter each identified by a different IP address, you do not need to specify LocalAddr. However, in this case you may use <span class="Italic">either</span> LocalAddr <span class="Italic">or</span><a href="localaddrname.html">LocalAddrName</a> to identify the adapter. If you specify both properties, the value of <a href="localaddrname.html">LocalAddrName</a> will be ignored.</p><p>Note that you may also set the value of LocalAddr to an empty character vector. In this case, the value returned by <tt>⎕WG</tt> will be <tt>'0:0:0:0'</tt>.</p><p>LocalAddr may only be specified in the <tt>⎕WC</tt> statement that creates the <a href="../objects/tcpsocket.html">TCPSocket</a> and may not subsequently be changed using <tt>⎕WS</tt>.</p></body>
