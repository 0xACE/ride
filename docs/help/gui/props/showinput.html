A value of 0 means that the corresponding cell is displayed normally. A value of 1 indicates that the cell is displayed using its associated input object, as it is when it is the current cell. ShowInput is relevant to cells displayed using <a href="../objects/combo.html">Combo</a> and <a href="../objects/button.html">Button</a> objects.</p><p>The example below illustrates the appearance of a <a href="../objects/grid.html">Grid</a> in which ShowInput is set to 0 for the Job Title column and 1 for the Region and Permanent columns.</p><p><img src="../images/show1.gif" /></p><p>The appearance of the same <a href="../objects/grid.html">Grid</a> but with ShowInput set to 0 throughout is illustrated below:</p><p><img src="../images/show2.gif" /></p></body>
