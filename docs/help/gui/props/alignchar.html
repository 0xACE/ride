It is useful to align columns of numbers that are formatted by the <a href="formatstring.html">FormatString</a> property. AlignChar may be a scalar or singleton that applies to all columns of the Grid, or a vector with one element per column.</p><p>If the data in the column is left-justified, it is aligned using the first occurrence of the alignment character in each cell counting from the left. If the data is right-justified, it is aligned using the first occurrence of the alignment character from the right-hand end of the text.</p><p>If the text in a cell does not contain an alignment character, it is aligned as if the alignment character were placed following the last digit.</p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
