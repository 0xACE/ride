Its value is effective only when the object is created with <tt>⎕WC</tt>. Changing InstanceMode with <tt>⎕WS</tt> has no effect. </p><p>If InstanceMode is <tt>'ExistingFirst'</tt>, APL attempts first to connect to a running instance of the OLE Server. If there is no running instance, it starts the OLE server to obtain a new object. </p><p>If InstanceMode is <tt>'ExistingOnly'</tt>, APL attempts to connect to a running instance of the object. If there is no running instance, it fails with a <tt>DOMAIN ERROR</tt>. </p><p>Note that in either case, if there is more than one instance running, there is no way to predict to which instance APL will be connected. </p><p>If InstanceMode is <tt>'New'</tt>, APL attempts to start the OLE Server to obtain a new object, whether or not the OLE Server is already running. However, if the OLE Server has registered itself as a single instance object and is already running, APL will be connected to it, and a second instance of the Server will not in fact be started. </p><script src="../../../help.js"></script></body>
