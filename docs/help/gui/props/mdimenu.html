If such a menu is defined, the <a href="caption.html">Caption</a>s of all the child <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a>s are automatically added to it below any other <a href="../objects/menu.html">Menu</a> or <a href="../objects/menuitem.html">MenuItem</a> objects that the application has created directly. This list is separated from the preceding items by a separator. The entry for the currently active <a href="../objects/subform.html">SubForm</a> is checked and the user may switch between <a href="../objects/subform.html">SubForm</a>s by selecting from this list.</p><p>Note that the additional separator and the items representing the list of child forms are not Dyalog APL/W objects and may not be accessed by the application. If you prefer to maintain your own "window list" you should not use this property.</p></body>
