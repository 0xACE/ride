Each item represents an object that may be docked. Notice that if you use a name, you must specify the simple name of the object, excluding any part of its full pathname that refers to a parent; i.e. the specified names must not contain any leading pathname information.</p><p>If the name of, or ref to, a <a href="dockable.html">dockable</a> object occurs in the DockChildren property, the host object will generate DockMove events when the client is dragged over it, and will generate a DockAccept event when a docking operation takes place.</p><p>If the name of , or ref to, the client object is not present in its DockChildren property, the object will not respond in any way as the client is dragged over it.</p><p>The following example shows the creation of 3 dockable forms, all of which are dockable in a host form called h1.</p><p>The first, <tt>c1</tt>, is a totally independent Form. When docked in <tt>h1</tt>, it will become a SubForm <tt>h1.c1</tt>. When undocked, it will revert to an independent Form <tt>c1</tt>.</p><p>The second, <tt>c2</tt>, is created initially as a child of <tt>h1</tt> and will therefore be displayed above it in the window stacking order. When docked it will become a SubForm <tt>h1.c2</tt>. When undocked, it will revert back to a dependant Form <tt>h1.c2</tt>. In all cases, it appears on top of <tt>h1</tt>.</p><p>The third, <tt>c3</tt>, is created initially as a child of another Form, <tt>h2</tt>. When docked (in <tt>h1</tt>) it will become a SubForm <tt>h1.c3</tt>. When undocked, it will become a dependant Form <tt>h1.c3</tt>, and will therefore appear above <tt>h1</tt> in the stacking order.</p><pre>
