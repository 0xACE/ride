If OnTop is set to 1, the <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a> or <a href="../objects/subform.html">SubForm</a> remains at the front even if it doesn't have the input focus. Indeed, it may partially obscure the <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a> that does have the focus. The default value is 0 (normal).</p><p>More than one <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a> may have OnTop set to 1. If so, these <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a>s appear on top of all others, but may overlap one another. Other applications may also have windows with this property.</p><p>For a graphical object, the OnTop property controls how it is drawn in a <a href="../objects/grid.html">Grid</a> relative to the grid lines and cell text. OnTop is applicable only if the graphic is the child of a <a href="../objects/grid.html">Grid</a> and is otherwise ignored.</p><table><tr><td>0</td><td>Graphical object is drawn behind grid lines and cell text</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Graphical object is drawn on top of grid lines but behind cell text</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Graphical object is drawn on top of grid lines and cell text</td></tr></table></body>
