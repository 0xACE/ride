In versions of Dyalog APL for other platforms, it has no effect.</p><p>This is a Boolean property that specifies the behaviour of a Form when the Input Panel is raised or lowered.</p><p>If SIPResize is 1 (the default), the <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a> generates a Configure event when the Input Panel is raised or lowered. Unless disabled or modified by a callback function, the Form is automatically resized to occupy the entire space above the Input Panel.</p><p>If SIPResize is 0, the <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a> does not generate a Configure event when the Input Panel is raised or lowered. This means that, at times, the lower part of the <a href="../objects/form.html">Form</a> may be obscured by the Input Panel.</p></body>
